    "Which category of majors had the lowest unemployment rates? Which category of majors had the highest female representation?\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT Major FROM recent_grads WHERE ShareWomen > 0.5\n",
    "Instead of returning all of the rows, we want SQLite to count the number of rows and return just that value. While we don't need to change the subset of data we're working with, we do need to change how it's presented to us. To return just the count, we need to use the SQL function COUNT() [https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#count]:\n",

    "A key idea in SQL is that everything is a table. One advantage of this simplification is that it's a common, visual representation that makes SQL approachable for a much wider audience. The disadvantage is that datasets and calculations that aren't well suited for this representation must be converted to be used in a SQL database environment.\n",

    "2. Finding a Column's Minimum and Maximum Values in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions like COUNT() are known as aggregate functions [https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html]. Aggregate functions are applied over columns of values and return a single value. MIN() and MAX(), for example, calculate and return the minimum and maximum values in a column.\n",

    "SELECT Major, MIN(ShareWomen) FROM recent_grads\n",
    "Major\tMIN(ShareWomen)\n",
    "MISCELLANEOUS ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES\t0.0\n",
    "If you think about it, MIN(ShareWomen) acts a row filter in some way. While the query SELECT Major FROM recent_grads returns all of the values in the Major column, the query SELECT Major, MIN(ShareWomen) FROM recent_grads only returned the Major column value corresponding for the row with the minimum value in the ShareWomen column.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that while COUNT() can be used on any column (because it's just counting the number of values), the other aggregate functions (MIN(), MAX(), etc) can only be used on numeric columns (since these arithmetic calculations only work with numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Write a query that returns the Engineering major with the lowest median salary.\n",

    "\n",
    "The final two aggregation functions we'll look at are SUM() and AVG(). Applying the SUM() function will add all of the values in a column while AVG() will compute the average. Lastly, the TOTAL() function also returns the sum as a floating point value (even if the column contains integers). The TOTAL() function should be used when working with a column containing floating point values. You can read more here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time around, we're going to skip showing sample code since these functions are used the same way as COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX(). This is good practice working with new functions, as SQL contains many functions that you'll end up using down the road that you haven't been taught explicitly.\n",

    "5. Customizing The Results\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the queries we've written so far have had somewhat unpleasant column names in the results, like AVG(SUM) and MIN(Men). Many companies use SQL environments and tools that can run your query, turn the results into a plot of your choosing, and then create a PDF report containing multiple plots (and some additional explanation from the user). Given that others may interpret and understand the results of your SQL queries, it's helpful to be able to specify custom names for the columns in our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do just that using the AS operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) as num_students FROM recent_grads\n",
    "This is known as an alias and the alias is restricted to just our results table (the table in the database won't be renamed). We can specify an arbitrary phrase as a string using quotation marks:\n",
    "\n",

    "Even better, we can drop AS entirely and just add the name next to the original column:\n",
    "\n",
    "SElECT COUNT(*) \"Total Students\" FROM recent_grads\n",
    "Lastly, we can reference renamed columns when writing longer queries to make our code more compact:\n",

    "WHERE (mc = 'Engineering') AND (ur > 0.04 and ur < 0.08)\n",
