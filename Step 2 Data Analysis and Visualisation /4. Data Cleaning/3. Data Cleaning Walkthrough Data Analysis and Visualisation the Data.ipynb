    "\n",
    "Over the last two missions, we began investigating possible relationships between SAT scores and demographics. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets containing information about New York City public schools. We cleaned them, then combined them into a single data set named combined that we're now ready to analyze and visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll discover correlations, create plots, and then make maps. The first thing we'll do is find any correlations between any of the columns and sat_score. This will help us determine which columns might be interesting to plot out or investigate further. Afterwards, we'll perform more analysis and make maps using the columns we've identified."

    "2. Finding Correlations With the r Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlations tell us how closely related two columns are. We'll be using the r value, also called Pearson's correlation coefficient, which measures how closely two sequences of numbers are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "An r value falls between -1 and 1. The value tells us whether two columns are positively correlated, not correlated, or negatively correlated. The closer to 1 the r value is, the stronger the positive correlation between the two columns. The closer to -1 the r value is, the stronger the negative correlation (i.e., the more \"opposite\" the columns are). The closer to 0, the weaker the correlation. To learn more about r values, see the statistics course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the following diagram have a strong positive correlation -- when the value in class_size is high, the corresponding value in sat_score is also high, and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "The r value for the columns in the diagram above is .99.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the following diagram have a strong negative correlation -- when the value in class_size is high, the corresponding value in sat_score is low, and when the value in sat_score is high, the value in class_size is low:\n",
    "\n",
    "The r value for the columns in the diagram above is -.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next diagram, the columns aren't correlated -- class_size and sat_score don't have any strong pattern in their values:\n",
    "\n",
    "The r value for the columns in the diagram above is -.02, which is very close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, r values above .25 or below -.25 are enough to qualify a correlation as interesting. An r value isn't perfect, and doesn't indicate that there's a correlation -- just the possiblity of one. To really assess whether or not a correlation exists, we need to look at the data using a scatterplot to see its \"shape.\" For example, here's a scatterplot with a very strong negative r value of -.73:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/correlation.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how in the image above, all of the points appear to fall along a line. This pattern indicates a correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a scatterplot with an r value of .15, which indicates a weak correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/no_correlation.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the data points in the image go in several directions, and there's no clear linear relationship. We'll explore correlations in greater detail later on in the statistics content. For now, this quick primer should be enough to get us through this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're interested in exploring the fairness of the SAT, a strong positive or negative correlation between a demographic factor like race or gender and SAT score would be an interesting result meriting investigation. If men tended to score higher on the SAT, for example, that would indicate that the SAT is potentially unfair to women.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the pandas pandas.DataFrame.corr() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html] method to find correlations between columns in a dataframe. The method returns a new dataframe where the index for each column and row is the name of a column in the original data set.\n",

    "From the map above, we can see that school density is highest in Manhattan (the top of the map), and lower in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've plotted the school locations, we can begin to display meaningful information on the maps, such as the percentage of English language learners by area.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can shade each point in the scatterplot by passing the keyword argument c into the scatter() method. This argument accepts a variable containing a sequence of numbers, assigns different colors to those numbers, and then shades the points on the plot associated with those numbers accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method will convert the sequence of numbers we pass into the c keyword argument to values ranging from 0 to 1. It will then map these values onto a colormap. Matplotlib has quite a few default colormaps [https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html]. In our case, we'll use the summer colormap, which results in green points for low numbers, and yellow points for high numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we plotted ell_percent by school. If we pass in the keyword argument c=combined[\"ell_percent\"], then the method would shade a school with a high ell_percent yellow, and a school with a low ell_percent green. We can specify the colormap we want to use by passing the cmap keyword argument to the scatter() method.\n",

    "Pass in the keyword argument zorder=2 to plot the points on top of the rest of the map. Otherwise the method will draw the points underneath the land.\n",
    "Pass in the keyword argument latlon=True to indicate that we're passing in latitude and longitude coordinates, rather than axis coordinates.\n",
    "Pass in the keyword argument c with the value combined[\"ell_percent\"] to plot the ell_percent.\n",

    "Unfortunately, due to the number of schools, it's hard to interpret the map we made on the last screen. It looks like uptown Manhattan and parts of Queens have a higher ell_percent, but we can't be sure. One way to make very granular statistics easier to read is to aggregate them. In this case, we can aggregate by district, which will enable us to plot ell_percent district-by-district instead of school-by-school.\n",
