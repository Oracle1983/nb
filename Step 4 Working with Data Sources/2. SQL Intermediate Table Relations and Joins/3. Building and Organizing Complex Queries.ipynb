    "2. Writing Readable Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Code is read much more often than it is written, so plan accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Even if you don't intend anybody else to read your code, there's still a very good chance that somebody will have to stare at your code and figure out what it does: That person is probably going to be you, twelve months from now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "—Raymond Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "Often quoted and paraphrased, this philosophy is especially important when writing SQL, where queries can quickly get visually complex. Taking the time to write your queries to be more easily understood will take a little extra time now, but will save you time when you come back to old queries that you have written, and help your colleagues when you're working in a data team.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious area when it comes to writing queries is the use of capitalization and whitespace. Because white space doesn't have any meaning in SQL, it can be used to help convey meaning in a complex query. Let's compare the same query written twice— first without whitespace and capitalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "select ta.artist_name artist, count(*) tracks_sold from invoice_line il\n",
    "inner join (select t.track_id, ar.name artist_name from track t\n",
    "inner join album al on al.album_id = t.album_id\n",
    "inner join artist ar on ar.artist_id = al.artist_id) ta\n",
    "on ta.track_id = il.track_id group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 10;\n",
    "And now, with whitespace and capitalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    ta.artist_name artist,\n",
    "    COUNT(*) tracks_sold\n",
    "FROM invoice_line il\n",
    "INNER JOIN (\n",
    "            SELECT\n",
    "                t.track_id,\n",

    "           ON ta.track_id = il.track_id\n",
    "GROUP BY 1\n",
    "ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10;\n",
    "As you can see, a little time put into whitespace and capitalization pays off. A few tips to help make your queries more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a select statement has more than one column, put each on a new line, indented from the select statement.\n",
    "Always capitalize SQL function names and keywords\n",
    "Put each clause of your query on a new line.\n",
    "Use indenting to make subqueries appear logically separate.\n",
    "Another important consideration when writing readable queries is the use of alias names and shortcuts. Name aliases should be clear– a common convention is using the first letter of the table name, however if you feel that a query is complex you should consider using more explicit aliases. Similarly, at times lines like GROUP BY 1 can be confusing, and explicitly naming the column will make your query more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in a team, you might consider a SQL style guide— a great guide is available at SQL style guide, but remember is that readability is more important than consistency. If you you have a complex query and you think breaking the style guide will make it more readable, you should do it.\n",

    "Throughout the rest of our SQL missions, be mindful of writing queries that are easy to read and understand. While we will continue to check answers based on the results of the queries (rather than taking into account the formatting), practicing this will make your future colleagues (and future self) thank you.\n",

    "3. The With Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing complex queries, it's useful to create an intermediate table to produce our final results. You can use subqueries to create these intermediate tables. Unfortunately, the way subqueries are written makes it harder to read— the person reading the query needs to find the subquery and read from the inside-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to alleviate this is to use a with clause. With clauses allow you to define one or more named subqueries before the start of the main query. The main query then refers to the subquery by it's alias name, just as if it's a table in the database.\n",
