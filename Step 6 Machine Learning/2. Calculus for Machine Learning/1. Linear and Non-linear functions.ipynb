    "In the previous course, we explored the machine learning workflow using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We chose the k-nearest neighbors algorithm because building the intuition for how the algorithm works doesn't require any mathematics. While the algorithm is easy to grasp, we can't use it for larger datasets because the model itself is represented using the entire training set. Each time we want to make a prediction on a new observation, we need to calculate the distance between each observation in our training set and our new observation, then rank by ascending distance. This is a computationally intensive technique!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, for most of the machine learning techniques we'll learn about next, the model is represented as a mathematical function. This mathematical function approximates the underlying function that describes how the features are related to the target attribute. Once we derive this mathematical function using the training dataset, making predictions on the test dataset (or on a future dataset) is computationally cheap. The following diagram shows 2 different linear regression functions that approximate the dataset (note that the values in this dataset are random).\n",
