    "1. Introduction to Command Line Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at the command line Python interpreter in the last mission. The interpreter lets us run Python commands and see their results immediately. It's very useful for testing snippets of code quicky, as well as debugging. But it's not a good way to develop Python programs, because the commands aren't saved anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop Python programs, we'll need to make files containing Python code. Then we'll be able to use the interpreter to run them from the command line. This way, we can save all of our commands, but still see what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very common way to develop with Python -- use an IDE or text editor to create Python files, then run them from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a file that Python can execute on the command line by adding some lines of Python code to a blank file. Here's an example of Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a Python script\")\n",
    "The code above will print Welcome to a Python script when we run it from the command line. To run it, we just need to put those lines into a file, save the file as file.py, and then call it with python file.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code works because the __name__ variable in Python scripts is automatically set to the name of the module. If the module is being run from the command line, the __name__ variable will be __main__ by default. Checking the __name__ variable allows us to tell whether a script is running from the command line or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a file called script.py in the /home/dq folder that contains the following code:\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a Python script\")\n",

    "3. Installing Packages that Extend Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are an important way to extend Python's functionality. We've worked with packages like matplotlib and pandas. The best way to install packages is to use the command line and a program called pip. The newest versions of Python include pip by default, so installing Python will automatically give you access to pip.\n",

    "4. Overview of Virtual Environments\n",

    "On the previous screen, we used the default version of pip to install requests for the python executable, which is Python version 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we had wanted to install requests for Python 3 instead? Different projects can require different packages and Python versions. This type of version switching can become confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, a computer system has one python executable, and we have to install all packages and libraries globally. This means that every single project on a machine has to use the same version of Python, and the same version of every package.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we can't use different versions of Python without some hacks. One such hack is renaming python to python3 so we can have access to both Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution is for each project we write to have its own version of Python, along with its own packages. This way, we don't need to worry that upgrading the version of a package will affect other projects on the system and cause them to stop working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments, or virtualenvs, let us do this. We can create a new virtualenv with the virtualenv command. While we normally have to install the virtualenv package first in order to access this command, we've already installed it for you to simplify the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing virtualenv main will create a virtualenv named main. It will create a folder in the current directory called main that will hold all of the packages we install into the virtual environment.\n",
