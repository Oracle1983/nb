    "At the end of the last mission, we fixed a first point on our curve, drew a secant line between that first point and another second point, and observed what happened when we moved the second point closer to the first point along the curve. The larger the interval between the 2 points on the x-axis, the more the steepness of the secant line diverged from the steepness of the curve. The closer the interval, the more the secant line started to match the steepness at the first point on the curve.\n",

    "In this mission, we'll formalize the idea of slope further and learn how to calculate the slope for nonlinear equations at any given point. As you go through the rest of this course, we strongly recommend following the math we present using pencil and paper. We'll start by introducing some mathematical notation that formalizes the observation we made at the end of the last mission. If we try to state the observation by plugging in values to the slope equation, we'll run into the division by zero problem:\n",
