    "1. Overview of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/], a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:\n",
    "\n",
    "population - The population as of 2015.\n",
    "population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.\n",
    "area - The total land and water area.\n",
    "You can download the SQLite database, factbook.db, from this GitHub repo [https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases] if you want to work with it on your own computer. In this guided project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database. First things first, let's get familiar with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we always introduced the name of the table and what the table looked like in the jobs.db database we worked with. We can actually query the database to get this information directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';\n",
    "In the last mission, we learned how to connect to a SQLite database and query it using the sqlite3 module. When working in the Jupyter notebook environment, we can actually use pandas to run SQL queries and display the results neatly as a DataFrame object. We create a sqlite3.Connection instance as usual and then use pandas.read_sql_query(sql, con) to handle running the query and returning the results in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect(\"factbook.db\")\n",
    "â€‹\n",
    "q = \"SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';\"\n",
    "pd.read_sql_query(q, conn)\n",
    "This will return the following data frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "type name tbl_name rootpage sql\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "0 table facts facts 2 CREATE\tTABLE\tfacts\t(\"id\"\tINTEGER\tPRIMARY\tKEY...\n",
    "1 table sqlite_sequence sqlite_sequence 3 CREATE\tTABLE\tsqlite_sequence(name,seq)\t\t\t\t\n",
    "If we had used the default sqlite3 querying method, we would have gotten back nested tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "[('table',\n",
    "  'facts',\n",
    "  'facts',\n",
    "  2,\n",

    "You may be wondering why we're using SQLite at all if we're just reading in the results into pandas dataframes anyway. Why not just use pandas? First, most data analysts and data scientists in industry use a SQL GUI based tool which:\n",
    "\n",
    "let you write queries and save them for later\n",
    "let you run queries against multiple enterprise database systems (MySQL, Postgres, etc.)\n",
    "return results as a table\n",
    "create standard visualizations like line charts, bar plots, and histograms from the results table without any programming\n",
    "Here are some examples of GUI based SQL tools:\n",

    "Jack DB [https://www.jackdb.com/]\n",
    "We're using pandas and matplotlib to display results nearly and visualize them because they let us focus on practicing thinking and working in SQL. You'll spend most of your time in SQL in this guided project and will inteface with pandas and matplotlib minimally.\n",
