    "In this course, we started by building intuition for model based learning, explored how the linear regression model worked, understood how the two different approaches to model fitting worked, and some techniques for cleaning, transforming, and selecting features. In this guided project, you can practice what you learned in this course by exploring ways to improve the models we built.\n",

    "You'll work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. You can read more about why the data was collected here [http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf]. You can also read about the different columns in the data here[https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt].\n",

    "2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now start to removing features with many missing values, diving deeper into potential categorical features, and transforming text and numerical columns. Update transform_features() so that any column from the data frame with more than 25% (or another cutoff value) missing values is dropped. You also need to remove any columns that leak information about the sale (e.g. like the year the sale happened). In general, the goal of this function is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "remove features that we don't want to use in the model, just based on the number of missing values or data leakage\n",
    "transform features into the proper format (numerical to categorical, scaling numerical, filling in missing values, etc)\n",
    "create new features by combining other features\n",
    "Next, you need to get more familiar with the remaining columns by reading the data documentation [https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt] for each column, determining what transformations are necessary (if any), and more. As we mentioned earlier, succeeding in predictive modeling (and competitions like Kaggle) is highly dependent on the quality of features the model has. Libraries like scikit-learn has made it quick and easy to simply try and tweak many different models, but cleaning, selecting, and transforming features is still more of an art that requires a bit of human ingenuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, we recommend adding some cells to explore and experiment with different features (before rewriting these functions).\n",
    "The transform_features() function shouldn't modify the train data frame and instead return a new one entirely. This way, we can keep using train in the experimentation cells.\n",
    "Which columns contain less than 5% missing values?\n",
    "For numerical columns that meet this criteria, let's fill in the missing values using the most popular value for that column.\n",
    "What new features can we create, that better capture the information in some of the features?\n",
    "An example of this would be the years_until_remod feature we created in the last mission.\n",
    "Which columns need to be dropped for other reasons?\n",
    "Which columns aren't useful for machine learning?\n",

    "Which columns in the data frame should be converted to the categorical data type? All of the columns marked as nominal from the documentation are candidates for being converted to categorical. Here are some other things you should think about:\n",
    "If a categorical column has hundreds of unique values (or categories), should you keep it? When you dummy code this column, hundreds of columns will need to be added back to the data frame.\n",
    "Which categorical columns have a few unique values but more than 95% of the values in the column belong to a specific category? This would be similar to a low variance numerical feature (no variability in the data for the model to capture).\n",
    "Which columns are currently numerical but need to be encoded as categorical instead (because the numbers don't have any semantic meaning)?\n",
    "What are some ways we can explore which categorical columns \"correlate\" well with SalePrice?\n",
    "Read this post for some potential strategies [http://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/].\n",
