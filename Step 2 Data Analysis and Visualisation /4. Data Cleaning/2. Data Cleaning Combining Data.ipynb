    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we began investigating possible relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about New York City public schools. We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the DBN column. All of the data sets are currently stored as keys in the data dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n",

    "In this mission, we'll clean the data a bit more, then combine it. Finally, we'll compute correlations and perform some analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll need to do in preparation for the merge is condense some of the data sets. In the last mission, we noticed that the values in the DBN column were unique in the sat_results data set. Other data sets like class_size had duplicate DBN values, however.\n",

    "While the main data set we want to analyze, sat_results, has unique DBN values for every high school in New York City, other data sets aren't as clean. A single row in the sat_results data set may match multiple rows in the class_size data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the class_size data set we should combine with the single matching entry in sat_results. Here's a diagram that illustrates the problem:\n",

    "Before we merge our data, we'll need to decide on the merge strategy we want to use. We'll be using the pandas pandas.DataFrame.merge() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html] function, which supports four types of joins -- left, right, inner, and outer. Each of these join types dictates how pandas combines the rows.\n",

Each data set also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the DBN values in sat_results in all of the other data sets, and other data sets may have DBN values that don't exist in sat_results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll merge two data sets at a time. For example, we'll merge sat_results and hs_directory, then merge the result with ap_2010, then merge the result of that with class_size. We'll continue combining data sets in this way until we've merged all of them. Afterwards, we'll have roughly the same number of rows, but each row will have columns from all of the data sets.\n",

    "With a left merge, we'd only use DBN values from the dataframe on the \"left\" of the merge. In this case, sat_results is on the left. Some of the DBNs in sat_results don't exist in class_size, though. The merge will handle this by assiging null values to the columns in sat_results that don't have corresponding data in class_size.\n",

Choosing a merge strategy is an important decision; it's worth thinking about your data carefully, and what trade-offs you're willing to make.\n",
