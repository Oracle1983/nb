We are going to focus our lesson on a machine learning technique called clustering, which allows us to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. Using 2 features allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. For point guards, it's widely accepted that the Assist to Turnover Ratio is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created.
