To explore this kind of data, you'll need to learn how to visualize the data on maps.\n",

While basemap uses Matplotlib to actually draw and control the map, the library provides many methods that enable us to work with maps quickly. Before we dive into how basemap works, let's get familiar with how to install it.\n",

    "The easiest way to install basemap is through Anaconda. If you're new to Anaconda, we recommend checking out our Python and Pandas installation project:\n",

    "The Basemap library has some external dependencies that Anaconda handles the installation for. To test the installation, run the following import code:\n",
    "\n",
    "from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap\n",
    "If an error is returned, we recommend searching for similar errors on StackOverflow to help debug the issue. Because basemap uses matplotlib, you'll want to import matplotlib.pyplot into your environment when you use Basemap."
