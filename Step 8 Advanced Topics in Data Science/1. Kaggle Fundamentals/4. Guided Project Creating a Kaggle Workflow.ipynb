    "1. Introducing Data Science Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, you've been learning about Kaggle competitions using Dataquest missions. Missions are highly structured and your work is answer checked every step of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guided projects, on the other hand, are less structured and focus more on exploration. Guided projects help you synthesize concepts learned during missions and practice what you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guided projects bridge the gap between learning using the Dataquest missions, and applying the knowledge on your own computer, and your answers are not checked like they are in regular missions, however you can access a solution notebook by using the top of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Guided projects is a great opportunity to practice some of the extra skills you'll need to do data science by yourself, including practicing debugging using all the tools at your disposal, including googling for answers, visiting Stack Overflow and consulting the documentation for the modules you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guided project uses Jupyter notebook, a web application which lets you combine text and code within a single file, and is one of the most popular ways to explore and iterate when working with data. The Jupyter notebook easily allows you to share your work, and makes exploring data much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with Jupyter notebook, we recommend completing our guided project on Using Jupyter notebook to familiarize yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we're going to put together all that we've learned in this course and create a data science workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science, and particularly machine learning, contain many dimensions of complexity when compared with standard software development. In standard software development, code not working as you expect can be caused by a number of factors along two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs in implementation\n",
    "Algorithm design\n",
    "Machine learning problems, have many more dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs in implementation\n",
    "Algorithm design\n",
    "Model issues\n",
    "Data quality\n",
    "The result of this is that there are exponentially more places that machine learning can go wrong.\n",

    "Why is machine learning 'hard'?\n",
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/188/why-is-ml-hard.png\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is shown in the diagram above (taken from the excellent post Why is machine learning 'hard'?) [http://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html]. The green dot is a 'correct' solution, where the red dots are incorrect solutions. In this illustration there are only a small number of incorrect combinations for software engineering, but in machine learning this becomes exponentially greater!\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining a workflow for yourself, you can give yourself a framework with which to make iterating on ideas quicker and easier, allowing yourself to work more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we're going to explore a workflow to make competing in the Kaggle Titanic competition easier, using a pipeline of functions to reduce the number of dimensions you need to focus on.\n",
