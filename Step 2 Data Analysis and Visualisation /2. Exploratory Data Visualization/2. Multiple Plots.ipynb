    "2. Matplotlib Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When we were working with a single plot, pyplot was storing and updating the state of that single plot. We could tweak the plot just using the functions in the pyplot module. When we want to work with multiple plots, however, we need to be more explicit about which plot we're making changes to. This means we need to understand the matplotlib classes that pyplot uses internally to maintain state so we can interact with them directly. Let's first start by understanding what pyplot was automatically storing under the hood when we create a single plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "a container for all plots was created (returned as a Figure object)\n",
    "a container for the plot was positioned on a grid (the plot returned as an Axes object)\n",
    "visual symbols were added to the plot (using the Axes methods)\n",
    "A figure acts as a container for all of our plots and has methods for customizing the appearance and behavior for the plots within that container. Some examples include changing the overall width and height of the plotting area and the spacing between plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can manually create a figure by calling pyplot.figure() [https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.figure]:\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = plt.figure()\n",
    "Instead of only calling the pyplot function, we assigned its return value to a variable (fig). After a figure is created, an axes for a single plot containing no data is created within the context of the figure. When rendered without data, the plot will resemble the empty plot from the previous mission. The Axes object acts as its own container for the various components of the plot, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "values on the x-axis and y-axis\n",
    "ticks on the x-axis and y-axis\n",
    "all visual symbols, such as:\n",
    "markers\n",
    "lines\n",
    "gridlines\n",
    "While plots are represented using instances of the Axes class, they're also often referred to as subplots in matplotlib. To add a new subplot to an existing figure, use Figure.add_subplot. This will return a new Axes object, which needs to be assigned to a variable:\n",

    "axes_obj = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number)\n",
    "If we want the figure to contain 2 plots, one above the other, we need to write:\n",

At the moment, the legend unfortunately covers part of the green line (which represents data from 1950).
