    "\n",
    "n the previous two missions, we covered the basics of PySpark, the MapReduce paradigm, transformations and actions, and how to do basic data cleanup in PySpark. In this challenge, you'll use the techniques you've learned to transform the text of Hamlet into a format that's more useful for data analysis.\n",

    "'hamlet@9',\n",

    "Transform the RDD split_hamlet into a new RDD hamlet_with_ids that contains the clean version of the line ID for each element.\n",

    "Recall that the map() function will run on each element in the RDD, where each element is a list that we can access using regular Python mechanics."
