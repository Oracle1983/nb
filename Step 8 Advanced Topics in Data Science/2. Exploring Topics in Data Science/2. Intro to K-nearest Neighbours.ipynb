In this case, we would compare the horsepower and racing_stripes values to find the most similar car, which is the Yugo. Because the Yugo is fast, we would predict that the Camaro is also fast. This is an example of 1-nearest neighbors, because we only looked at the most similar car.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Normalizing Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that horsepower in the last example had a much larger impact on the final distance than racing_stripes did. That's because horsepower values are much larger in absolute terms, and therefore dwarf the impact of racing_stripes values in the Euclidean distance calculations.\n",

    "This can be bad, because having larger values doesn't necessarily make a variable better at predicting which rows are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to deal with this problem is to normalize all of the columns to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that no single column has a dominant impact on the Euclidean distance calculations.\n",
