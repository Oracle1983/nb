    "Accidents are an unfortunate fact of air travel. Although flying is statistically safer than driving, minor and major flying accidents occur daily. In this project, we'll work with a data set of airplane accident statistics to analyze patterns and look for any common threads.\n",

    "We'll be working with a data set that contains 77,282 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them.
