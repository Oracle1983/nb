As a result, unlike any of the places you've written SQL queries so far, including a semicolon (;) is necessary in the SQLite shell. If you don't use it, the shell will not know if you are finished writing your query. Let's write a query to look at one of our tables from the Chinook database.\n",

    "\n",
    "The table below shows each of the types, along with examples of data commonly stored in the type, and some 'equivalent' types from other database systems. If you're not familiar with these other types, don't be concerned - we'll cover them in some more detail in a later course.\n",

    "3. Primary and Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",

    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/192/chinook_pk_fk.svg\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously learned that each table has one or more columns shaded in yellow, which indicates they are the primary key. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row - you cannot have two rows in a table with the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "When two tables have a relation, there will be a column in one table that is a primary key in another table. For example, in the invoice_line table, the invoice_id column is the primary key from the invoice table. This is known as a foreign key. By defining a foreign key, our database engine will prevent us from adding rows where the foreign key value doesn't exist in the other table, which helps to prevent errors in our data (note that by default SQLite doesn't force foreign key constraints, however we have changed the default for this mission).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a primary key is specified as part of a create statement. Once the primary key is defined, the database engine will prevent any new rows from being added to the database if they have the same primary key as any existing rows. If we wanted to re-create the table from the previous exercise with a primary key, we would use this syntax:\n",

    "    purchase_date TEXT,\n",

    "    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)\n",
