    "In this guided project, we're going to learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import data into SQLite\n",
    "Design a normalized database schema\n",
    "Create tables for our schema\n",
    "Insert data into our schema\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with a file of Major League Baseball [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball] games from Retrosheet[http://www.retrosheet.org/]. Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file we will be working from game_log.csv, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been pre-cleaned to remove some inconsistencies. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which we will normalize this data into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main file, we have also included three 'helper' files, also sourced from Retrosheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "park_codes.csv\n",
    "person_codes.csv\n",
    "team_codes.csv\n",
    "These three helper files in some cases contain extra data, but will also make things easier as they will form the basis for three of our normalized tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important first step when working with any new data is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA gets us familiar with the data and gives us a level of background knowledge that will help us throughout our project. The methods you use when performing EDA will depend on what you plan to do with the data. In our case, we're wanting to create a normalized database, so our focus should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming familiar, at a high level, with the meaning of each column in each file.\n",
    "Thinking about the relationships between columns within each file.\n",
    "Thinking about the relationships between columns across different files.\n",
    "We have included a game_log_fields.txt file from Retrosheet which explains the fields included in our main file, which will be useful to assist our EDA. You can use !cat game_log_fields.txt in its own Jupyter cell to read the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with baseball some of this can seem overwhelming at first, however this presents a great opportunity. When you are working with data professionally, you'll often encounter data in an industry you might be unfamiliar with - it might be digital marketing, geological engineering or industrial machinery. In these instances, you'll have to perform research in order to understand the data you're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball is a great topic to practice these skills with. Because of the long history within baseball of the collection and analysis of statistics (most famously the Sabermetrics featured in the movie Moneyball), there is a wide range of online resources available to help you get answers to any questions you may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started exploring the data by using pandas to read and explore the data. Setting the following options after you import pandas is recommendedâ€“ they will prevent the DataFrame output from being truncated, given the size of the main game log file:\n",
    "\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_columns', 180)\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_rows', 200000)\n",
    "pd.set_option('max_colwidth', 5000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Using pandas, read in each of the four CSV files: game_log.csv, park_codes.csv, person_codes.csv, team_codes.csv. For each:\n",
    "Use methods and attributes like DataFrame.shape, DataFrame.head(), and DataFrame.tail() to explore the data.\n",
    "Write a brief paragraph to describe each file, including for the helper files how the data intersects with the main log file.\n",
    "Research any fields you are not familiar with, using both the text file and Google as needed. In particular, you should explore and write a short paragraph on:\n",
    "What each defensive position number represents.\n",
    "The values in the various league fields, and which leagues they represent."

    "2. Importing Data into SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert data into a noramalized database, we'll need a single column that can be used as a primary key. The game log file does not have a single column that can be used as a primary key to uniquely identify each game. There are three ways that we could handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a compound primary key, such as a primary key of the date, h_name, and number_of_game columns.\n",
    "Insert an integer primary key, eg where the first row is 1, the second row is 2, etc.\n",
    "Insert a new column using a custom format.\n",
    "Because we have not yet normalized our data, it's better not to start with a compound primary key - if we do this, we might end up needing to create a compound key in another table that includes this compound key, which would quickly become cumbersome to work with. An integer primary key is a good choice, but we should first explore whether Retrosheet already have a system for uniquely identifying each game. If they do, this is a better option. It means that if at some later stage we choose to incorporate more detailed game data into our database, the keys we use will be compatible with other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the Retrosheet site, we can find this data dictionary [http://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm] for their event files, which list every event within each game. This includes the following description:\n",
    "\n",
    "id: Each game begins with a twelve character ID record which identifies the date, home team, and number of the game. For example, ATL198304080 should be read as follows. The first three characters identify the home team (the Braves). The next four are the year (1983). The next two are the month (April) using the standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). The last digit indicates if this is a single game (0), first game (1) or second game (2) if more than one game is played during a day, usually a double header The id record starts the description of a game thus ending the description of the preceding game in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that this essentially makes a custom key using the three columns we identified in our composite key example earlier. After we import the data, we'll construct this column to use as a primary key in our final database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to import the data into SQLite. There are three key ways to import data into a SQLite database:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the Python SQLite library\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python SQLite library [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html] gives us ultimate control when importing data. We will first need to get the data into Python - we might choose to use the csv module for this. Next, we would use the Cursor.execute() [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute] method to create a table for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can use the Cursor.executemany() [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.executemany] method to insert multiple rows of data in a single command. If we create our connection object with a filename that doesn't exist, the sqlite module will create the database file for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take advantage of the ? placeholder value syntax instead of using python string formatting to prevent SQL injection attacks (like the hilarious XKCD 'Bobby Tables' comic example) and maintain the correct data types. Even though in this project we won't be running any external user code, this is an extremely good habit to get into. Here's what our syntax would look like for the last step:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list_of_lists = [\n",
    "    [4, 4, 8, 2],\n",
    "    [5, 1, 6, 3],\n",
    "    [5, 2, 4, 6]\n",
    "]\n",
    "c = \"\"\"\n",
    "INSERT INTO table_name (\n",
    "    column_one,\n",
    "    column_two,\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    ") VALUES (\n",
    "    ?,\n",
    "    ?\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    ");\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "cur.executemany(c, my_list_of_lists)\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that we have the highest level of control over what we're doing. Additionally, if we have larger data, we can write a loop that iterates over our source line by line so that we don't have to read all of it into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that there is a lot of manual data handling required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library includes a handy DataFrame.to_sql() [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html] method that we can use to send the contents of a dataframe to a SQLite connection object. We can either create the table first using the method above, or if the table does not exist, pandas will create it for us. Here's an example of what that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dataframe.to_csv('table_name', sqlite_connection_object, index=False)\n",
    "Most of the time, we'll want to use index=False, otherwise pandas will create an extra column for the pandas index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that it can often be done with a line or two of code. The disadvantage is that pandas may alter the data as it reads it in and converts the columns to types automatically. Additionally, this requires the data to be small enough to be able to be stored in-memory using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the SQLite shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method is to use the SQLite shell to import the data. Like the pandas method, we can either create the table manually ourselves, or rely on SQLite to do it for us. Here's the commands you would use to import a CSV using the SQLite shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "sqlite> .mode csv\n",
    " sqlite> .import filename.csv table_name\n",
    "This is one of the quickest methods to use and works well with large data sources. There are several minor inconveniences to this method. SQLite detects the column types using the first row of data, which can lead to incorrect types. You'll need SQLite shell access, which you won't always have. Lastly, if you want to create the table yourself, you will need to remove the header from the first line of your CSV, otherwise SQLite will make that the first row of your table.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of these methods, unless we explicitly create the table, the table will be created with no primary key. For now this isn't a problem as we'll be migrating this data into new, normalized tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the pandas method in this instance, because we've already read the data into dataframes. The type conversion isn't a big issueâ€“ as outlined above we will move the data into new tables and can handle type conversion then.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Just like in the previous guided project, our database retains 'state', so if we run a query that creates or modifies a table twice, the query will fail. Some commands like CREATE TABLE support IF NOT EXISTS which will allow you to run your notebook without these errors. You should consult the SQLite documentation [https://sqlite.org/lang.html] for the availability and syntax of these clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Recreate the run_command() and run_query() functions from the previous guided project, which you can use\n",
    "Use DataFrame.to_sql() to create tables for each of our dataframes in a new SQLite database, mlb.db:\n",
    "The table name should be the same as each of the CSV filename without the extension, eg game_log.csv should be imported to a table called game_log.\n",
    "Using run_command(), create a new column in the game_log table called game_id:\n",
    "Use SQL string concatenation to update the new columns with a unique ID using the Retrosheet format outlined above."

    "3. Looking for Normalization Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about database normalization in the previous mission, we mentioned that there were normal forms, a series of 5 progressive stages. Each of these stages have specific rules about the structure of the data that you can use to normalize.\n",
    "\n",

    "Non-primary key columns should be attributes of the primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key of our game log is our game_id, but the players name are not attributes of a game, but of the player id. If the only data we had was the game log, we would remove this column and create a new table that had the names of each player. As it happens, our person_codes table already has a list of our player IDs and names, so we can remove these without the need for creating a new table first.\n",

    "Lastly, we want to eliminate any redundant data - that is, columns where the data is available elsewhere. A good example of this can be found in our park_codes table, which will form the basis of our eventual park table.

    "4. Planning a Normalized Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've started to think about normalization ideas, it's time to start planning our schema. The best way to work visually with a schema diagram, just like the ones we've used so far in this course. Start by creating a diagram of the four existing tables and their columns, and then gradually create new tables that move the data into a more normalized state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people like to do this on paper, others use diagramming tools like Sketch or Figma, others like using Photoshop or similar. Our recommendation is that the best way to do this is using a schema designing tool like DbDesigner.net. This free tool allows you to create a schema and will create lines to show foreign key relations clearly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't be afraid to experiment. It's unlikely that your first few steps will be there in your finished product - try things and see how they look.\n",
    "If you're using a tool like DbDesigner [https://dbdesigner.net/] which automatically shows lines for foreign key relationships, don't worry if your lines look messy. This is normalâ€“ you can move the tables around to neaten things up at the end, but don't waste time on it while you are still normalizing.\n",
    "The following facts about the data may help you with your normalization decisions:\n",
    "Historically, teams sometimes move between leagues.\n",
    "The same person might be in a single game as both a player and a manager\n",
    "Because of how pitchers are represented in the game log, not all pitchers used in a game will be shown. We only want to worry about the pitchers mentioned via position or the 'winning pitcher'/ 'losing pitcher'.\n",
    "It is possible to over-normalize. We want to finish with about 7-8 tables total.\n",
    "Lastly, we advise spending between 60-90 minutes on your planning your schema. In the next step, we will introduce our suggested schema that we will work with for the rest of the project, but working as much of it out yourself is highly recommended.\n",
