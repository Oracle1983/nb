    "\n",
    "In these shell tutorials, we've been interacting with a computer through the command line. We type commands in, they execute, and we see the results. Those interactions occur within a shell, which is a way to access and control a computer. Command line shells have a text interface for typing commands and viewing results, as opposed to graphical shells, which allow us to click on icons with a mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many UNIX shells, Bash is one of the most popular. Bash is the default shell on most Linux and OS X computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash is essentially a program that lets us run other programs. It does this by implementing a command language. This language specifies how to type and structure the commands we want to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "A command language is a special kind of programming language through which we can control applications and the system as a whole. Just like Python and other programming languages, we can use Bash to create scripts, set variables, and more. Because it's a language, Bash is far more powerful than a graphical shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can set variables on the command line by assigning values to them. In the command line environment, variables consist entirely of uppercase characters, numbers, and underscores. We can assign any data type to a variable. Here are a few examples of how we can set variables on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "OS=linux\n",
    "OPERATING_SYSTEM=\"linux\"\n",
    "Both of the variables above, OS and OPERATING_SYSTEM, will actually end up with the same value. That's because quotes are optional when using strings in Bash, unless the string contains a space. Bash is sensitive to spaces, so strings that have them won't work properly if we don't surround them with quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment won't work, for example:\n",

    "ANIMAL=Shark with a laser beam on its head\n",
    "This one will:\n",
    "\n",
    "ANIMAL=\"Shark with a laser beam on its head\"\n",

    "2. Accessing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bash, we can access the value of a variable again after we set it, just like we can with other programming languages like Python. There's one major difference, though -- we need to add a dollar sign to the beginning of the variable name when we try to retrieve its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create a variable named FOOD with the value Shrimp gumbo, for example, we'll need to use $FOOD when we want to access the value again later. This is because typing FOOD at the command prompt will attempt to call the command FOOD. It will return an error, because there's no executable command named FOOD in PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between Python variables and Bash variables is that when we type $FOOD at the command prompt, it will resolve to the value of the variable, or Shrimp gumbo. By default, Bash will try to turn this value into a command named Shrimp, and then call it. Because there's no executable named Shrimp in PATH, this will generate an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to see the value of a variable named FOOD, we'll need to type echo $FOOD. This will become echo \"Shrimp gumbo\", which will print Shrimp gumbo to stdout.\n",

We can run any program in any one of these folders just by typing the program's name.

Programs can have any number of positional arguments, including zero. python is an example of a program that doesn't require any positional arguments.\n",
