Each row represents a single college major, and contains information about post-graduation employment of students who studied the major. You can find out more about the data set in FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repository for the project. Here are some descriptions for just a few of the 21 total columns:\n",

    "2. Calculating Group-Level Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY SQL statement allows us to compute summary statistics by \"group,\" or unique value. When we use this statement, SQL creates a group for each unique value in a column or set of columns (the same values we get when we use the DISTINCT statement), and then does the calculations for them. To illustrate, we can find the total number of people employed in each major category with the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT SUM(Employed) \n",
    "FROM recent_grads \n",
    "GROUP BY Major_category;\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us the total number of employed graduates for each major category. Here's a truncated view of the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "SUM(Employed)\n",
    "66943\n",
    "288114\n",
    "302797\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows aggregate counts of the Employed column for each Major_category. Unfortunately, it doesn't indicate which major category each row refers to. We can fix this by including the Major_category column in our query:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Major_category, SUM(Employed) \n",
    "FROM recent_grads \n",
    "GROUP BY Major_category;\n",
    "This makes the output much easier to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "Major_category\tSUM(Employed)\n",

    "Arts\t288114\n",
    "Biology & Life Science\t302797\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the query works. The GROUP BY statement splits the Major_category column into groups (with one group for each unique major category), then calculates the sum for each group. The following diagram shows how GROUP BY splits the data. (The diagram uses a small sample from the recent_grads table.):\n",
    "\n",
    "For each group, the GROUP BY statement queries each column, and runs all of the aggregation functions we include in the query after the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a column is selected, the SQL engine will use the last value for that column in the group. If an aggregation function is selected, the SQL engine will compute the value for that aggregation function across the group.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Querying Virtual Columns With the HAVING Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to select a subset of rows after performing a GROUP BY query. On the last screen, for instance, we may have wanted to select only those rows where share_employed is greater than .8. We can't use the WHERE clause to do this because share_employed isn't a column in recent_grads; it's actually a virtual column generated by the GROUP BY statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to filter on a column generated by a query, we can use the HAVING statement. Here's an example:\n",

    "FROM recent_grads \n",
    "GROUP BY Major_category \n",
    "HAVING share_employed > .8;\n",
    "Note that we used the same column name in the HAVING statement that we originally specified with the AS statement. SQL allows us to use custom column names in subsequent statements, including HAVING and WHERE. The statement above will result in the following output:\n",
