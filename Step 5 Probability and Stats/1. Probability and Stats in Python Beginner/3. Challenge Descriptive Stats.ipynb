    "In this challenge, you'll practice the statistical techniques you learned in the previous missions. These techniques are referred to collectively as descriptive statistics since they're used to describe and understand a dataset and not directly for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FiveThirtyEight team recently released a dataset containing the critics scores for a sample of movies that have substantive (at least 30) user and critic reviews from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB, and Fandango. Whenever a movie is released, movie review sites ask their approved network of critics and their site's user base to rate the movie. These scores are aggregated and the average score from both groups are posted on their site for each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are links to the page for Star Trek Beyond for each site:\n",

    "Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "Fandango\n",
    "Metacritic\n",
    "IMDB\n",
    "The dataset contains information on most movies from 2014 and 2015 and was used to help the team at FiveThirtyEight explore Fandango's suspiciously high ratings. You can read their analysis here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with the file fandango_score_comparison.csv, which you can download from their Github repo [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango]. Here are some of the columns in the dataset:\n",

    "FILM - film name.\n",
    "RottenTomatoes - Rotten Tomatoes critics average score.\n",
    "RottenTomatoes_User - Rotten Tomatoes user average score.\n",
    "RT_norm - Rotten Tomatoes critics average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).\n",
    "RT_user_norm - Rotten Tomatoes user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).\n",
    "Metacritic - Metacritic critics average score.\n",
    "Metacritic_user_nom - Metacritic user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).\n",
    "Metacritic_norm - Metacritic critics average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).\n",
    "Fandango_Ratingvalue - Fandango user average score (0 to 5 stars).\n",
    "IMDB_norm - IMDB user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).\n",
    "The full column list and descriptions are available at FiveThirtyEight's Github repo. Let's focus on the normalized user scores for now and generate histograms to better understand each site's distributions.\n",

    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a matplotlib subplot grid with the following properties:\n",
    "4 rows by 1 column,\n",

    "The most obvious things that stick out is that essentially all of the Fandango average user reviews are greater than 3 on a 5 point scale. The distributions of the Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores, on the other hand, more closely resemble a normal distribution, which is generally what you'd expect if you knew nothing else. This is because the normal distribution is the most common distribution in nature and is used to approximate many phenomenon. Starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is normal is incredibly common, especially when you don't have a clear generative model to understand how the data was generated.\n",

Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic have more spread out scores (high variance) and the mean is around 3. Fandango, on the other hand, has low spread (low variance) and a much higher mean, which could imply that the site has a strong bias towards higher reviews. IMDB is somewhere in the middle, with a low variance, like Fandango's user reviews, but a much more moderate mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it seems like something is especially fishy about Fandango's ratings, which was the inspiration behind the FiveThirtyEight post to begin with. Since Fandango's main business is selling movie tickets, it's possible their primary incentive may differ from pure review sites like Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic.\n",
