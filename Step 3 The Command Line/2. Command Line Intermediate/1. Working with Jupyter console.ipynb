    "1. Jupyter console\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter console, formerly known as IPython, is an enhanced Python interpreter. From our earlier missions, you may recall that by typing python on the command line, you get access to an interactive shell that lets you write and execute Python code. Jupyter console enhances this shell, and adds several niceties that make working with data easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it's useful to use the shell in situations where you need to quickly test some code you're writing. This happens frequently when you're writing data analysis scripts. It can also be used to quickly explore datasets and do basic analysis. Another use case is prototyping code before later saving it to a script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Jupyter console and Jupyter notebook is that the console functions in interactive mode. Whenever you type a line of code, it is immediately executed, and you can see the results. If you want to write medium-length pieces of code or do deep exploration of a dataset, the notebook is better. If you want to test out code you're writing, or run quick commands, the console is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter project is in the midst of rebranding from IPython to Jupyter. Depending on the version of Jupyter you have installed, you can access the console by typing either jupyter console or ipython at the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Open the Jupyter console by typing ipython.\n",
    "Once you access it, you can run Python commands. Type print(10) to see what happens.\n",

    "2. Getting help\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter console has a robust built-in help system. You can get help in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can type ? after starting the console. This will display help about Jupyter. You can exit by typing q.\n",
    "You can type %quickref. This is a magic that will tell you some useful commands. We'll talk more about Jupyter magics shortly.\n",
    "If you want information about a variable, just type the name of the variable, followed by ?. For information on the dq variable, you'd type dq?.\n",
    "Type help() to get access to Python help. This will enable you to get help on all the modules and functions currently available. You can quit by typing quit.\n",
    "If you want to use the Python help system to get information on a variable, type help(variable_name). If you wanted help with the variable dq, you'd type help(dq).\n",
    "Being able to get help will let you see which methods are allowed on which objects, and be able to better understand the capabilities of Jupyter console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Open the Jupyter console by typing ipython.\n",
    "Assign the value 5 to the variable dq.\n",

    "4. Jupyter magics\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have used the %quickref Jupyter magic in the last screen. Magics are special Jupyter commands that always start with %. They enable you to access Jupyter-specific functionality, without Python executing your commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful magics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "%run -- allows you to run an external Python script. Any variables in the script will be stored in the current kernel session.\n",
    "%edit -- opens a file editor. Any code you type into the editor will be executed by Jupyter when you exit the editor.\n",
    "%debug -- if there's an error in any of your code, running %debug afterwards will open an interactive debugger you can use to trace the error.\n",
    "%history -- shows you the last few commands you ran.\n",
    "%save -- saves the last few commands you ran to a file.\n",
    "%who -- print all the variables in the session.\n",
    "%reset -- resets the session, and removes all stored variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a full list of magics here. [http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/interactive/magics.html]\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the %run, %who, and %debug magics to iteratively develop scripts with Jupyter console. Have your favorite editor open, and start writing a Python script. In a separate shell, open Jupyter console. As you get to checkpoints in your script where you want to test it out, use the %run magic to run the script. Check the values of the variables using the %who magic. If you see any errors, debug them with the %debug magic. If you want to clear the session, use %reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a Python script using nano.\n",
    "Add in whatever code you want, but make sure you add at least one print statement, and at least one variable definition.\n",
