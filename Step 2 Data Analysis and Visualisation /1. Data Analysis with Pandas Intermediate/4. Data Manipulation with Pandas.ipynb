    "In the previous mission, we learned how to explore a pandas DataFrame. In this mission, we'll explore how to manipulate a DataFrame and make transformations to it. We'll continue to work with the same data set from the USDA on nutritional information. We'll build a basic nutritional index for people who want to eat high-protein, low-fat foods. The \"Lipid_Tot_(g)\" column contains each food's total fat content, and the \"Protein_(g)\" (in grams) contains each food's total protein content (in grams). Let's use the following formula to score each food in our data set:\n",

    "5. Normalizing Columns in a Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the data set use different units (kilo-calories, milligrams, etc.). As a result, the range of values varies greatly between columns. For example, the \"Vit_A_IU\" column ranges from 0 to 100000, while the \"Fiber_TD_(g)\" column ranges from 0 to 79. For certain calculations, columns like \"Vit_A_IU\" can have a greater effect on the result, due to the scale of the values.\n",

    "While there are many ways to normalize data, one of the simplest ways is called rescaling. The outcome of rescaling is that every value in a numeric column will range between 0 and 1 (with the column's minimum value being 0 and the maximum value being 1). Here's the formula for rescaling:\n",
