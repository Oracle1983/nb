We also learned how to create scatter plots to explore how ratings on one site compare with ratings on another site. We ended the mission with the observations that user ratings from Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes spanned a larger range (1.0 to 5.0) while those from Fandango and IMDB spanned a smaller range (2.5 to 5 and 2 to 5 respectively).\n",

Recall that you can download the dataset fandango_scores.csv from the FiveThirtEight Github repo [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango]. We've read the dataset into pandas, selected the columns we're going to work with, and assigned the new Dataframe to norm_reviews."
