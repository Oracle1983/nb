    "1. Introduction to Version Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working on a team, everyone will generally be making changes to the same files. Imagine you're working on a project to write a Python script, and have a folder with the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "script.py\n",
    "README.md\n",
    "Here are the contents of script.py:\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "Imagine that you and a coworker are both working on the project at the same time. You modify script.py like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "    print(\"Here's my amazing contribution to this project!\")\n",
    "And your coworker does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(10 + 10)\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "Imagine that you both have the folder on your local machine. To modify files, you make changes, then upload the entire folder to a centralized location like Dropbox or Google Drive to enable collaboration. If you didn't have a distributed version control system, whoever changed the file last would overwrite the changes of the other person.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach becomes extremely frustrating and impossible to manage as you start dealing with larger and larger chunks of code. What if the folder had 100 files, you modified 10 of them, and your coworker modified 30 at the same time? You don't want to lose your changes every time your coworker uploads his version of the folder. Now, imagine that instead of just you and a coworker, it's a project with 10 or 100 contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies face this problem every day, which is why distributed version control systems exist. These systems will \"merge\" changes together intelligently, enabling multiple developers to work on a project at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the script.py file, if we intelligently merged the two versions, the end result would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(10 + 10)\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "    print(\"Here's my amazing contribution to this project!\")\n",
    "There are a few distributed version control systems, including Mercurial and Subversion. Git is by far the most popular, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a command-line tool we can access by typing git in the shell. The first step in using Git is to initialize a folder as a repository. A repository (or \"repo\") tracks multiple versions of the files in the folder, enabling collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can initialize a repository by typing git init inside the folder we want to use for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a folder named random_numbers.\n",
    "Navigate into this folder and initialize a Git repository."

    "2. The .git Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing a Git repository will create a folder called .git inside the repository folder. That means there should now be a folder named .git inside of our random_numbers folder. Files and folders with a period prefix (.) are typically private, and don't show up by default when we list the files in a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's verify that the file is there with ls -al. As you may recall, the -a flag will show everything in a folder, even if it starts with a period.\n",

    "3. Creating Files in the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical Git workflow involves adding files, making changes, and then storing a checkpoint (or \"snapshot\") of those changes. These checkpoints are called commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing every file in every commit, Git stores the diff, or the things that change between commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that we created a file called README.md with this content:\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my readme!\n",
    "When we commit it, Git would store the file. Let's say we added another line to the file later on and made another commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my readme!\n",
    "Here's another line.\n",
    "Git would only store the part of the file that changed since the last commit, which is Here's another line..\n",
    "\n",
    "Every project is a sequence of commits. Commits give us a powerful way to merge the changes of multiple team members together. We can even restore the repository to an earlier checkpoint, or moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we make a commit, let's add some files to our folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Create a file named README.md with the following content:\n",
    "Random number generator\n",

    "4. Checking File Status\n",
    "\n",
    "Files can have one of three states in Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "committed - The current version of the file has been added to a commit, and Git has stored it.\n",
    "staged - The file has been marked for inclusion in the next commit, but hasn't been committed yet (and Git hasn't stored it yet). You might stage one file before working on a second file, for example, then commit both files at the same time when you're done.\n",
    "modified - The file has been modified since the last commit, but isn't staged yet.\n",
    "After we make changes to a Git repository, we can run the git status command to check the state of each file within it. Any files that don't show up in git status are in the committed state (i.e., don't have unsaved changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Git will automatically show us which files have been modified since the last commit. If we're ready to commit the files we've modified, we can add them to the staging area using git add. Typing git add script.py will add script.py to the staging area, where it will be staged for the next commit.\n",
