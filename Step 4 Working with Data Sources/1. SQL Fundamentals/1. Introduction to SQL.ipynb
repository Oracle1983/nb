    "Pandas Workflow\n",

    "\n",
    "The pandas workflow works well when:\n",
    "\n",
    "the data fits in memory (a few gigabytes but not terabytes)\n",
    "the data is relatively static (doesn't need to be loaded into memory every minute because the data has changed)\n",
    "only a single person is accessing the data (shared access to memory is difficult)\n",
    "security isn't important (security is critical for company scale production situations)\n",
    "When the data changes frequently, requires shared access, doesn't fit in memory, and security is critical, a database is a much better solution. A database is a data representation that lives on disk that can be queried, accessed, and updated without using much memory. We primarily interact with a database using a database management system [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database] or DBMS for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pandas workflow, we spend most of our time thinking about what functions and methods to use, where to store intermediate results in variables, and juggling all of these. To work with data stored in a database, we instead use a language called SQL (or structured query language). In SQL, we express each unique request (whether it be fetching a subset of or editing values in the data) as a single query and then ask the DBMS to run the query and display any results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to fetch a specific subset of the data from a database, we would:\n",
    "\n",
    "write the SQL query: SELECT * FROM salaries\n",
    "ask the DBMS to run the query and display the results to us\n",
    "Here's what the database workflow looks like:\n",

    "Database Workflow\n",

    "Because the data lives on disk, we can work with datasets that consume multiple terabytes of disk space. Many data science teams in industry have servers and setups in cloud environments like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services that let team members work with this scale of data. Robust and popular DBMS tools like Postgres and MySQL include powerful features for managing user credentials, security, and high data throughput (quickly changing data). In this course and the next, we'll learn the fundamentals of SQL using a small, portable DBMS called SQLite. SQLite is the most popular database in the world and is lightweight enough that the SQLite DBMS is included as a module in Python. In later courses, we'll dive into production systems like Postgres.\n",

    "In this course, we'll explore data from the American Community Survey on job outcome statistics based on college majors. While the original CSV version can be found on FiveThirtyEight's Github [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors], we'll be using a slightly modified version of the data that's stored as a database. We'll be working with a of the data that contains the 2010-2012 data for recent college grads only. In this mission, we'll learn how to write SQL queries to explore and start to understand the dataset."
