By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own.

Here are the first few rows of the dataset:\n",

    "sex -- the gender of the victim. Either M or F.\n",

From the census dataset, we know that the number of people in the White racial category is 197318956. We'd divide 66237 by 197318956:\n",

If you do this computation, you'll see that the rate is a very small number, 0.0003356849303419181. It's for this reason that it's typical to express crime statistics as the \"rate per 100000\". This tells you the number of people in a given group out of every 100000 that were killed by guns in the US. To get this, we just multiply by 100000:\n",
