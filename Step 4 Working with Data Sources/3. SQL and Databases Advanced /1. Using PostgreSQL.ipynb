    "1. SQLite vs PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been using a database engine called SQLite. SQLite is one of the most common database engines, and has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is stored in a single file, making it portable.\n",
    "You can use a SQLite database directly from Python, and don't need a separate program running.\n",
    "It implements most SQL commands, enabling you to use most of the statements you're familiar with.\n",
    "However, particularly when developing larger applications, SQLite has a few downsides that make other database engines more attractive:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one process at a time can write to the database. When you have a complex web application, you may have multiple processes updating information in the database at the same time. For example, on Facebook, one process might handle updating user information, and another might handle generating the news feed.\n",
    "You can't take advantage of performance features, such as caching. Because a SQLite database is a single file, and it doesn't require a special program to run, it can't have performance optimizations like caching. When running a site like Facebook that has a ton of traffic, it's important to be able to lookup data quickly.\n",
    "SQLite doesn't have any built-in security. With a production website, it's common to want some people to be able to modify tables in a database (write), and others to only be able to make SELECT queries to tables in the database (read). This is because giving someone write access to the database can be a security risk, in that they can update or overwrite data. SQLite doesn't allow for restricting access to a database in this way.\n",
    "In general, SQLite is good in cases where having a small and simple database engine is important. SQLite is used extensively in embedded applications, such as Android and iOS applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where there will be multiple users or performance is important, PostgreSQL is the most commonly used database engine. PostgreSQL is open source, and is free to download and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll look at the basics of PostgreSQL, then dive into creating a database, querying data, and some advanced features."

    "2. PostgreSQL overview\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is an extremely powerful database engine. At a high level, PostgreSQL consists of two pieces, a server and clients. The server is a program that manages databases and handles queries. Clients communicate back and forth to the server. Only the server ever directly accesses the databases -- the clients can only make requests to the server. If you've gone through the APIs and Web Scraping course, the communication process is very similar to making requests to a remote API.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of this model is that multiple clients can communicate with the server at the same time. This allows multiple processes to write to a database at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to run a PostgreSQL server either remotely or locally. If it's remote, you connect to it via the internet. If it's local, you connect to it on your own machine. In both cases, you'll be connecting to PostgreSQL via a system port.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of ports is to think of receiving mail at an apartment building. Let's say 5 people live in an apartment building, but they only have a single address. All incoming mail will come to the address, then have to be sorted out and given to each person:\n",
    "\n",
    "All incoming mail is merged into a single pile, because the whole apartment building only has one address. Each apartment occupant then has to sort through the pile to find their mail. Not only is this inefficient, it also results in some apartments getting mail that isn't theirs by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make life easier for everyone by giving each apartment its own address:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, nobody has to sort mail, and it's unlikely that someone will accidentally get a message that isn't theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer runs dozens to hundreds of programs. Many of these programs can accept incoming connections from the internet. For instance, web servers, such as the servers that run Dataquest, run on ordinary computers and accept connections from people all over the world. Once the connections are created, data is sent along the connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If every program received data in the same stream, you'd have a similar situation to all of the apartments only having one address. Each program would be responsible for figuring out which messages were for it, and many messages would be sent to the wrong program. It would be impossible to know which program you were communicating with when you connected to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid this is for each program to have its own address. A system port is similar to an apartment number in that a port on a computer can only be used by one server at a time. For example, web servers run on port 80. Any incoming messages on this computer port are automatically sent to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, PostgreSQL uses port 5432 to communicate with the outside world. If you start a PostgreSQL server, it will listen for incoming connections on port 5432. Clients will be able to connect to the server using this port. If you start a client, you'll have to specify which server to connect to, along with the port to connect to."

    "3. Psycopg2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many clients for PostgreSQL, including graphical clients. The most common Python client for PostgreSQL is called psycopg2. Connecting to a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 is similar to connecting to a SQLite database using the sqlite3 libary. psycopg2 also uses Connection and Cursor objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd connect to a database using psycopg2 like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "import psycopg2\n",
    "conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=postgres user=postgres\")\n",
    "cur = conn.cursor()\n",
    "You may notice that we have to specify both a database name and a user name. A PostgreSQL server can have multiple databases and multiple users, so we need to specify which user we're connecting as, and which database we're connecting to.\n",
    "\n",
    "When PostgreSQL is first installed, the default user account is called postgres, with an associated database called postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice that we didn't specify a server to connect to, or a port to connect using. psycopg2 will default to connecting to port 5432 on the current computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done with a Connection object, you should close it to avoid issues where one connection prevents another from executing a query. You can close a connection like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "Closing a connection will terminate the client's connection with the PostgreSQL server. It's a good idea to close a connection whenever you're done executing your queries.\n",

    "4. Creating a table\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've connected to a database, we can create a table inside that database. You may recall the CREATE TABLE statement from an earlier mission:\n",

    "   column1 dataType1 PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "5. SQL Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you checked the database dq now, you would notice that there actually isn't a notes table inside it. This isn't a bug -- it's because of a concept called SQL transactions. With SQLite, every query we made that modified the data was immediately executed, and immediately changed the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "With PostgreSQL, we're dealing with multiple users who could be changing the database at the same time. Let's imagine a simple scenario where we're keeping track of accounts for different customers of a bank. We could write a simple query to create a table for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE accounts(\n",
    "   id integer PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   name text,\n",
    "   balance float\n",
    ");\n",
    "Let's say we have the following two rows in the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "id    name    balance\n",
    "1     Jim     100\n",
    "2     Sue     200\n",
    "Let's say Sue gives 100 dollars to Jim. We could model this with two queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance=200 WHERE name=\"Jim\";\n",
    "​\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance=100 WHERE name=\"Sue\";\n",
    "In the above example, we remove 100 dollars from Sue, and add 100 dollars to Jim. Let's say either the second UPDATE statement has an error in it, the database fails, or another user has a conflicting query. The first query would run properly, but the second would fail. That would result in the following:\n",
    "Jim would be credited 100 dollars, but 100 dollars would not be removed from Sue. This would cause the bank to lose money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions prevent this type of behavior by ensuring that all the queries in a transaction block are executed at the same time. If any of the transactions fail, the whole group fails, and no changes are made to the database at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we open a Connection in psycopg2, a new transaction will automatically be created. All queries run up until the commit [http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.commit] method is called will be placed into the same transaction block. When commit is called, the PostgreSQL engine will run all the queries at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't want to apply the changes in the transaction block, we can call the rollback [http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.rollback] method to remove the transaction. Not calling either commit or rollback will cause the transaction to stay in a pending state, and will result in the changes not being applied to the database.\n",
