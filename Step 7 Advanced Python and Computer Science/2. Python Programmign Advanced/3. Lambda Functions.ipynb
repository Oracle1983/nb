    "1. Introduction to String Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll dive into string manipulation, which is essential to working with data that's represented as text. Similar to a list, string objects are indexed so we can access specific characters quickly. If we want to access the first character in my_string, we write my_string[0], just like we would to get the first element in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the index to slice string objects, or select the fragments we want and pull them out. When we slice a string, we select a chunk or substring from the original string. To select a specific character, we only need to specify one number -- the character's index. When slicing a string, we specify a range of values for the indices instead of just a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the first four characters in a string, for example, what we're really asking for are the characters from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) of the string. To represent ranges in Python, we would specify the starting index as 0, but the ending index as 4. Python uses the ending index to stop iterating and doesn't return the character at index 4; this is one of the language's quirks! If we want the characters from index 2 to index 5 (inclusive), we would need to specify 2 as the starting index and 6 as the ending index, rather than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent ranges, we still use bracket notation like before. Now we specify two numbers though -- the starting index and the ending indexâ€”and separate them with a colon. If we want the first four characters of the string object my_string, for example, we write:\n",

    "We can also take advantage of Python's flexibility with ranges to omit the starting or ending index to create interesting effects. If we omit the first index, the Python interpreter will assume you want to start at the beginning, or index 0, and stop at the ending index. If we omit the ending index, the interpreter will assume you want to grab all the characters from the starting index all the way until the end of the string.\n",

    "3. Skipping Indices in a Slice with Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you got a taste of slicing, let's explore some other ways we would want to select a substring from a string. What if we want to select every odd character in a string? Specifically, how do we select all of the characters at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on? With what we know so far, we would have to iterate through every character and throw away all of the even characters. Alternatively, we could create a list with just the odd indices, and write a for loop to iterate and select only the characters at those indices. Thankfully, there's a simpler way!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can enter a third number in our range that controls the distance between each character we want to select. This value is known as the step value, which is 1 by default. Let's see how we can use that functionality to select all of the characters in password that have odd indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "password = \"password\"\n",
    "odds = my_string[1:8:2]\n",
    "The slice [1:8:2] specifies that we want to start the substring at index 1, and add 2 to the index each time until it observes or exceeds index 8. Therefore, the string object odds should be set to the value \"asod\", which correspond to the four characters at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7. If we didn't provide a step value, the interpreter would have defaulted to 1 and odds would contain all of the characters beginning at index 1, instead of just the ones at odd indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "By similar logic, password[0:6:4] would result in \"pw\". We would start at index 0, extract \"p\", step to index 4, and finally extract \"w\". If we step again, the index would be at 8, which is beyond our ending index of 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do advanced slicing with relatively simple notation by combining this technique with the technique of omitting indices. Instead of writing password[0:6:4], for example, we could write password[:6:2].\n",

    "Now let's talk about lambda functions, which we also call anonymous functions. We use lambda functions when we only want to run a function once, and don't need to save it for reuse. On the last screen, for example, we wrote the is_palindrome() function, but only used it once. Because the logic for is_palindrome() only consisted of one line, it would have been more convenient to write and apply the logic only when we needed it (when we executed the filter() function).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely what lambda functions allow us to do. The syntax is different than what we've been exposed to before. Syntactically, we represent a lambda function like this:\n",

    "Passing a lambda function into another function is similar to passing a value into a function, rather than a variable. Instead of referring to our function by name (for instance, my_func()), we're simply passing the function in as a raw value. This is analogous to passing in \"hello world\" instead of my_string. It can take a while to get used to the idea of functions as values, but the concept is very powerful. Lets look at a more detailed example.\n",
