    "At Dataquest, we're huge believers in learning through doing, and we hope this shows in your learning experience. While missions focus on introducing concepts, challenges allow you to perform deliberate practice by completing structured problems. You can read more about deliberate practice here and here. Challenges will feel similar to missions, but with little instructional material and a greater focus on exercises.\n",

For this challenge, you'll be using the data that the team at FiveThirtyEight derived from the 2010-2012 American Community Surveys. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the data set and made it available in a Github repository. [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors]\n",
