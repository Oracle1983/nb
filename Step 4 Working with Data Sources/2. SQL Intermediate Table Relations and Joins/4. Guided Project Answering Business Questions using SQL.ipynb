    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll give you a task, and you'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data\n",
    "Create plots where necessary to visualize the data\n",
    "Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.\n",
    "We'll continue to use the Chinook database that we've used in earlier missions of this course. The Chinook database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db. A copy of the database schema is below - you'll need to come back to this step often to consult the schema as you write your queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "chinook schema\n",
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/chinook-schema.svg\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth remembering that our database retains 'state', so if we run a query with a CREATE or DROP twice, the query will fail. We should have the skills to get ourselves untangled from these situations, but if you have trouble, or if you manage to lock your database, we have provided a chinook-unmodified.db file that you can copy over the chinook.db to restore it back to its initial state (see this blog post on how to run shell commands within a Jupyter notebook) [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/#17executingshellcommands].\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the queries you'll create in this guided project are more difficult than what you have written in the earlier missions in this course, and we'll provide you with less explicit guidance on how to answer each business question. Don't be discouraged if working on these queries takes several iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a solution notebook (accessible via the icon at the top of the interface), however we recommend only consulting this as a last resort, or when you have finished and would like to see how we went about the step. Also keep in mind that there are often several 'correct' ways to write these queries, and that our solution notebook shows just one of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips to keep in mind while working on these queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your query in stages, and run it as you go to make sure at each stage it's producing the output you expect.\n",
    "If something isn't behaving as you expect, break parts of the query out into their own, separate queries to make sure there's not an inner logic error.\n",
    "Don't be afraid to write separate queries to check the underlying data, for instance you might write a query that you can use to manually check a calculation and give yourself confidence that the output you're seeing is correct.\n",
    "If you do get stuck, don't forget your support options. [https://www.dataquest.io/help/article/yJqIwwQFW9-what-support-do-i-get]"

    "2. Creating Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SQL fundamentals course we learned how to use python's SQLite module and pandas to write queries that produced dataframe outputs. The advantage of dataframe outputs is that they will display as tables in Jupyter notebook. We can also take advantage of pandas plotting methods to easily create visualizations of our that displayed in tables inside our Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't familiar with pandas plotting methods, we recommend this guided project from our Data Visualization course, which teaches some of these methods. The visualization section of the pandas [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html] docs be useful - we encourage you to have a look and see if you can use a few plot types that you might not have already used before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we used the sqlite3.connect() [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect] function to create a connection object, and passed that to the pandas.read_sql_query() function. In this project, we'll use a similar approach, with two important changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create some helper functions in python to save some time.\n",
    "We'll use a context manager to handle the connection to the SQLite database.\n",
    "Context managers make our life easy by taking care of opening and closing the connection to the database, as well as making sure we don't accidentally make changes to the database if one of our queries has an error. If you're interested in learning more about context managers, we recommend this excellent article by Jeff Knupp [https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/]. For now, all we need to know is that we'll use the with statement [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement] to access the context manager that's built-in to the SQLite module:\n",
    "\n",
    "with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "    # we can now access `conn`\n",
    "    # inside an indented block\n",
    "    query_result = pd.read_sql(my_query, conn)\n",
    "With a few extra lines, we can turn this code into a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def run_query(q):\n",
    "    with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "        return pd.read_sql(q, conn)\n",
    "By returning the dataframe, we can just run our function as the last line of a Jupyter cell and it will print the results nicely for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also create a function to run SQL queries that don't return tables, like CREATE VIEW. In this instance, we don't need to use pandas, we can simply use the SQLite module's connection.execute() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:\n",
    "    conn.isolation_level = None\n",
    "    conn.execute(c)\n",
    "The conn.isolation_level = None line above tells SQLite to autocommit any changes - we'll talk more about that in the next mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll make a function that uses our run_query() function to return a list of all tables and views in our databases - this is handy to quickly check the state of our database as we work. To make this easier, the query you'll need to use in this function is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    name,\n",
    "    type\n",
    "FROM sqlite_master\n",
    "WHERE type IN (\"table\",\"view\");\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Import the SQLite, pandas and matplotlib modules, and use the magic command %matplotlib inline to make sure any plots render in the notebook.\n",
    "Create a run_query() function, that takes a SQL query as an argument and returns a pandas dataframe of that query.\n",
    "Create a run_command() function that takes a SQL command as an argument and executes it using the sqlite module.\n",
    "Create a show_tables() function that calls the run_query() function to return a list of all tables and views in the database.\n",
    "Run the show_tables() function."
