    "6. Understanding Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the concept of inheritance enables us to organize classes in a tree-like hierarchy, where the parent class has some traits that it passes on to its descendants. When we define a class, we specify a parent class from which it inherits. Inheriting from a class means that the behavior of the parent also exists in the child, but that the child can still define its own additional behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a Player class with generic information about NBA players. This would be very useful because players have a lot of things in common. However, we may also want to add specific behavior for different positions. We can define classes like Center, Forward, or Point Guard, each with behavior that's specific to that position. These classes would each specify Player as its parent class. They would all be siblings -- each would inherit the same behaviors from the Player class, while also having special behaviors of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3, every class is a subclass of a generic object class. While this happens automatically when we don't specify an ancestor, it's sometimes good practice to be explicit. For the remainder of this mission, we'll specify when a class has object as its parent while we code. This is a good programming practice -- if we get into the habit of specifying a class's ancestry, we won't forget to specify a parent when it's something other than object. It's simply a way to form good habits."

    "7. Overloading Inherited Behavior\n",

    "When a class inherits from a parent class, it acquires all of the behavior of that parent class. There are times when we don't want all of that behavior, though, or want to modify it slightly for our custom class. We use a technique called overloading to accomplish this.\n",

    "Overloading inherited behavior involves assigning new behavior to our custom class. To accomplish this, we just redefine the method on our new class.\n",

The operators work because classes like string have implemented them specifically. It's a bit difficult to understand why the object class would need to have these methods, however. The best way to wrap your head around this is through an example.\n",

    "Let's consider the addition operator (+). The object class already defines a method for addition. The sum() function is defined using this addition method, but the object class doesn't really know how to add integers or floating points specifically.\n",
