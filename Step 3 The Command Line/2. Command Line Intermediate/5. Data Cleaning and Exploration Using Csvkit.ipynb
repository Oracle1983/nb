    "So far, we've been using the default command line tools to clean, munge, and explore data. Tools like wc and head are useful tools, but weren't designed specifically for working with datasets and are limited in many ways. These tools lack features specific to working with tabular datasets, like parsing the header row or understanding the row and column layout. Because of this, in the Data Munging Using the Command Line challenge, you had to specifically compute the number of lines in each CSV file using the wc tool and use that number to select just the non-header rows using the tail tool. You then had to repeat this for each CSV file you were trying to merge into the resulting, single file!\n",

    "In this mission, we'll learn about the Csvkit library, which supercharges your workflow by adding 13 new command line tools specifically for working with CSV files. We'll focus on these 5 tools from Csvkit:\n",

    "To start, let's circle back to the task of merging 3 CSV files into 1 file. We can use csvstack [http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/scripts/csvstack.html#description] tool to consolidate the rows from multiple CSV files and redirect the stdout to a new file:\n",
    "\n",
    "csvstack file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv > final.csv\n",
    "As long as the header row for each file in the stdin to csvstack is the same, the first row in the resulting file will match this header row. After the header row, final.csv will contain all of the non-header rows from file1.csv, then all of the non-header rows from file2.csv, then finally the non-header rows from file3.csv. If you don't redirect the stdout of csvstack to a file or a tool like head, the full output will be rendered in the terminal. This can cause your terminal to grind to a halt as it tries to process and display all of the output and you want to be extra careful to avoid doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you peeked at the documentation [http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/scripts/csvstack.html#description], you may have noticed that the behavior of csvstack can be modified using a few different flags. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "if you want to be able to trace the file where each row originated from in the merged file, you can use the -g flag to specify a grouping value for each filename. When stacking the rows from a file, csvstack will add the corresponding value in a new column. Lastly, you can use the -n flag to specify the name of this new column. The following code will create a new column named origin, containing the values 1, 2, or 3 depending on which file that row originated from:\n",
