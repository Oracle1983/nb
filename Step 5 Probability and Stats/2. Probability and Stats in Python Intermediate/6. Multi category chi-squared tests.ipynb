Instead, we see that the observed proportion is .036, which indicates that there may be some correlation between the sex and high_income columns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finding that a result isn't significant doesn't mean that no association between the columns exists. For instance, if we found that the chi-squared test between the sex and race columns returned a p-value of .1, it wouldn't mean that there is no relationship between sex and race. It just means that there isn't a statistically significant relationship.\n",
    "Finding a statistically significant result doesn't imply anything about what the correlation is. For instance, finding that a chi-squared test between sex and race results in a p-value of .01 doesn't mean that the dataset contains too many Females who are White (or too few). A statistically significant finding means that some evidence of a relationship between the variables exists, but needs to be investigated further.\n",
    "Chi-squared tests can only be applied in the case where each possibility within a category is independent. For instance, the Census counts individuals as either Male or Female, not both.\n",
    "Chi-squared tests are more valid when the numbers in each cell of the cross table are larger. So if each number is 100, great -- if each number is 1, you may need to gather more data."
