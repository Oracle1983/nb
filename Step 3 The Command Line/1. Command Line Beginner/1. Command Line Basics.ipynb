    "Most people interact with a computer through a graphical user interface (GUI), a visual interface that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a screenshot of the desktop from a Macintosh computer. There's an icon for each program, and we can click on one to launch the corresponding program. Before GUIs came along, the most common way to interact with a computer was through a command line interface, which we also refer to as a shell or terminal (we'll use these terms interchangeably in this mission). A command line interface lets us switch between folders and launch programs by typing commands. A command line interface is often faster and more powerful than a GUI for programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all programmers and data scientists make extensive use of the terminal, and knowing how to interact with it is a critical skill. Every operating system has a slightly different terminal with different commands and syntax. Because Linux and OS X are both based on an older operating system called UNIX, they both have very similar terminals. Windows isn't based on UNIX, so it has different commands. It's more common to use Linux and OS X for data science work, so our terminal missions will use Linux. In particular, we'll be running Ubuntu 14.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the right is a terminal interface. The dollar sign is called the command prompt. Anything we type to the right of it is a shell command that will execute immediately when we press the Enter key.\n",

    "Type pwd into the terminal to the right, and press the Enter key on your keyboard.\n",
    "This command returns the current directory (folder you're located in). It's an acronym that stands for print working directory."

    "When we typed pwd on the last screen, the terminal printed out the name of the folder we were in. The terminal was designed to navigate and switch between directories. You've probably browsed through directories using a GUI like Explorer in Windows, or Finder in OS X. The terminal lets us do the same thing, except that we type a command instead of clicking on a folder name. Once you learn the terminal, you'll see that using it to navigate through directories is much faster than using a GUI.\n",

That means our current folder path is /home/dq. home is a folder that exists at the root of the filesystem; consider it the \"master\" or \"original\" folder.

We indicate that home is at the root of the filesystem with the leading slash -- /home.\n",
