    "Algorithms that take constant multiples of n steps (where n is the input size) are still linear time. For instance, an algorithm that takes 5n steps, or even 0.5n steps, is linear time. If we have an algorithm that prints the first half of a list (and we know the length of the list ahead of time), the algorithm will take 0.5n time. Even though it takes less than n time, we still consider it linear.\n",
