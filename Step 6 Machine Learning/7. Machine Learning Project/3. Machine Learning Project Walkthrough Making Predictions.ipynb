    "We spent the last 2 missions cleaning and preparing a dataset that contains data on loans made to members of Lending Club. Our eventual goal is to generate features from the data, which can feed into a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm will make predictions about whether or not a loan will be paid off on time, which is contained in the loan_status column of the clean dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we prepared the data, we removed columns that had data leakage issues, contained redundant information, or required additional processing to turn into useful features. We cleaned features that had formatting issues, and converted categorical columns to dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we noticed that there's a class imbalance in our target column, loan_status. There are about 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (positive case, label of 1) than those that weren't (negative case, label of 0). Imbalances can cause issues with many machine learning algorithms, where they appear to have high accuracy, but actually aren't learning from the training data. Because of its potential to cause issues, we need to keep the class imbalance in mind as we build machine learning models.\n",

    "2. Picking an error metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into predicting loan_status with machine learning, let's go back to our first steps when we started cleaning the Lending Club dataset. You may recall the original question we wanted to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "We established that this is a binary classification problem in the first mission of this course, and we converted the loan_status column to 0s and 1s as a result. Before diving in and selecting an algorithm to apply to the data, we should select an error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "An error metric will help us figure out when our model is performing well, and when it's performing poorly. To tie error metrics all the way back to the original question we wanted to answer, let's say we're using a machine learning model to predict whether or not we should fund a loan on the Lending Club platform. Our objective in this is to make money -- we want to fund enough loans that are paid off on time to offset our losses from loans that aren't paid off. An error metric will help us determine if our algorithm will make us money or lose us money.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're primarily concerned with false positives and false negatives. Both of these are different types of misclassifications. With a false positive, we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't. This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram to simplify the concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loan_status and prediction columns, a 0 means that the loan wouldn't be paid off on time, and a 1 means that it would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives. A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible. They'd be more okay with missing out on opportunities (false negatives) than they would be with funding a risky loan (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate false positives and true positives in Python. We can use multiple conditionals, separated by a & to select items in a NumPy array that meet certain conditions. For instance, if we had an array called predictions, we could select items in predictions that equal 1 and where items in loans[\"loan_status\"] in the same position also equal 1 using this:\n",
    "\n",
    "filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans[\"loan_status\"] == 1)\n",
    "predictions[tp_filter]\n",
    "The above code will give us all the items in predictions that are true positives -- where we predicted that the loan would be paid off on time, and it was actually paid off on time. By using the len function to find the number of items, we can find the number of true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the diagram above as a reference, it's possible to compute the other 3 quantities we mentioned -- false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n",

    "\n",

    "4. Class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned earlier that there is a significant class imbalance in the loan_status column. There are 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (1), than loans that weren't paid off on time (0). This causes a major issue when we use accuracy as a metric. This is because due to the class imbalance, a classifier can predict 1 for every row, and still have high accuracy. Here's a diagram that illustrates the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram, our predictions are 85.7% accurate -- we've correctly identified loan_status in 85.7% of cases. However, we've done this by predicting 1 for every row. What this means is that we'll actually lose money. Let's say we loan out 1000 dollars on average to each borrower. Each borrower pays us 10% interest back. So we make a projected profit of 100 dollars on each loan. In the above diagram, we'd actually lose money:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we made 600 dollars in interest from the borrowers that paid us back, but we lost 1000 dollars on the one borrower who never paid us back, so we actually ended up losing 400 dollars overall, even though our model is technically accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's important to always be aware of imbalanced classes in machine learning models, and to adjust your error metric accordingly. In this case, we don't want to use accuracy, and should instead use metrics that tell us the number of false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we should optimize for:\n",
    "\n",
    "high recall (true positive rate) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Recall]\n",
    "low fall-out (false positive rate) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval#Fall-out]\n",
    "We can calculate false positive rate and true positive rate, using the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false negatives, and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "False positive rate is the number of false positives divided by the number of false positives plus the number of true negatives. This divides all the cases where we thought a loan would be paid off but it wasn't by all the loans that weren't paid off:\n",
    "\n",
    "fpr = fp / (fp + tn)\n",
    "True positive rate is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives. This divides all the cases where we thought a loan would be paid off and it was by all the loans that were paid off:\n",

    "\n",
    "False Positive Rate -- \"what percentage of my 1 predictions are incorrect?\"\n",
    "In this case, \"what percentage of the loans that I fund would not be repaid?\"\n",
    "True Positive Rate -- \"what percentage of all the possible 1 predictions am I making?\"\n",
    "In this case, \"what percentage of loans that could be funded would I fund?\"\n",
    "Generally, if we want to reduce false positive rate, true positive rate will also go down. This is because if we want to reduce the risk of false positives, we wouldn't think about funding riskier loans in the first place.\n",

When we use this to evaluate error, we get an unrealistically high depiction of how accurate the algorithm is, because it already \"knows\" the correct answers. This is like asking someone to memorize a bunch of physics equations, then asking them to plug numbers into the equations. They can tell you the right answer, but they can't explain a concept that they haven't already memorized an equation for.\n",

This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this technique is that since it has to preserve an equal ratio, you have to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throw out many rows of data. If we wanted equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0 and where loan_status is 1, one way we could do that is to delete rows where loan_status is 1.\n",

    "Generate fake data. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to generate new rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of these techniques are especially easy. The second method we mentioned earlier, telling the classifier to penalize certain rows more, is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0.\n",
