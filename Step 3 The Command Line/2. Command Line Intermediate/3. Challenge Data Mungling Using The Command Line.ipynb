    "In this challenge, you'll practice the command line concepts you've learned so far by munging datasets using just the command line. Data munging involves transforming datasets to make them easier to work with. Some datasets are too large to load into Python, so looking at them or transforming them beforehand can be useful. Even for smaller datasets, simple exploration on the command line is faster than exploration in Python, and file-based tasks like unifying datasets can be faster on the command line.\n",

    "The goal is to eventually get this into a Pandas Dataframe so let's combine the datasets into one file so it can be read in easily. Since each dataset contains the same columns, you need to combine the datasets into one file. You can't, however, just use append the full contents of each file to one final file since each dataset contains the header row. The consolidated file should only contain the header row once (in the first row). You need to instead append the header row to the consolidated file once, then append only the non-header rows from the 3 datasets to the consolidated file.\n",
