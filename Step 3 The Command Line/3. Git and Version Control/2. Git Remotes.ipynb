    "1. Introduction to Remote Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful ways to use Git is in conjunction with GitHub, a website built on Git, but with a familiar GUI interface. Using Git with GitHub allows us to push our code to remote repositories. This enables us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Share our code with others and build a portfolio.\n",
    "Collaborate with others on a project and build code together.\n",
    "Download and use code others have created.\n",
    "Here's an example of a remote repository on GitHub. People can view your public repositories on your GitHub profile. Using GitHub is a great way to build a portfolio and get recruiters to notice you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories aren't just useful for building a portfolio. Pushing to GitHub also allows us to collaborate with others on code. For example, thousands of different contributors are developing Linux on GitHub. Many companies, including Google and Facebook, also use GitHub to work on code projects across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories also enable us to access and use code we didn't write. For instance, this repo will let us download Amazon's Deep Learning tools and start training models. Because the reposistory is public, anyone can download and use it. Repositories on GitHub can also be private, in which case they're hidden, and not accessible to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download a remote repository to your own computer, you'll need to clone it. cloning copies a repository from one location (in this case, a remote one) to a folder on your computer. The repository retains all of its Git history, and you can work with it just like you would with a Git repository you created yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the git clone command to clone a remote repository. If we were cloning a repository we found on GitHub, we'd specify the GitHub URL for that repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we'd typically clone the Amazon Deep Learning repo [https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne] from GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git\n",
    "https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git is the URL for the Git repository we're cloning. Our clone command will automatically create a folder named amazon-dsstne in our current folder, and place the repository there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because we're working with a simplified remote repository for the purposes of this mission, we'll clone it a bit differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone /dataquest/user/git/chatbot\n",
    "This will clone the repository from /dataquest/user/git/chatbot, a path on our local computer, to our current folder, and place it in a subfolder named chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify a second argument to git clone, we can change the folder the repository saves to:\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone /dataquest/user/git/chatbot silentbot\n",
    "This command will place the chatbot repository in a folder called silentbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Clone the /dataquest/user/git/chatbot repository into the home folder of the current user. This should create a folder called chatbot in /home/dq."

    "2. Making Changes to Cloned Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've cloned a repository, we can makes changes to it, just like we did in the last mission. We'll be able to edit files, add them to the staging area, and then commit the changes. The local version of the repo will then reflect the changes, but the remote version won't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the following diagram carefully. It illustrates the relationship between the local repo and the remote repo, and how they're separate:\n",
    "\n",
    "After making the commit in the diagram, the local repo will have one more commit than the remote repo, and the file README.md will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most GitHub projects include a README.md file, which helps people understand what the project is about and how to install it. It's common to write the README file in Markdown format, which allows us to create lists and other complex but useful structures in plain text. The Markdown format has an .md file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the diagram above, we'll edit the README.md file to add a line, then commit it to the repository. It's important to add informative messages when comitting to shared repositories, so that other people can figure out what each commit is doing without having to read through the code. This is very important when debugging code that multiple people are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "cd into the /home/dq/chatbot folder to navigate to the chatbot repo.\n",
    "Add the line This project needs no installation to the bottom of README.md.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every Git repository consists of one or more branches. Each branch contains a slightly different version of the code. We'll discuss branches and how they work in greater detail in the next mission. For now, the important fact to know is that the main branch of a Git repo is typically called master. Developers create separate branches when they want to work on new features for a project, then add the commits in those branches back into master when the features are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the changes we've made so far have been on the master branch of the chatbot repo. The master branch is usually the most up-to-date shared version of any code project.\n",

    "4. Pushing Changes to the Remote\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've made changes to the local version of a repo, we can push those changes to the remote repo so that everyone can see them. Edits we make locally are only reflected in our local repo. Unless we push them to the remote, the remote repo doesn't change.\n",

    "To do this, we'll need to use the git push command, which pushes commits from our local repo to the remote repo. Here's a diagram showing what happens when we run git push:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the diagram shows, until we push the branch to the remote repo, the changes are only in our local repo. Pushing to the remote will update the remote with our latest changes. Anyone else who pulls from the remote repo will then have access to the same two commits that we have in our local repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run git push, we need to specify both the name of the remote repo to push to, and the name of the branch we're pushing. When we clone a repo, Git automatically names the remote repo origin. This means that the following command will push the master branch to the remote repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "It's possible, but rare, that a remote will have a name other than origin. If we're unsure, we can list the remote(s) associated with our local repo using git remote.\n",

    "5. Viewing Individual Commits\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from the previous mission, Git stores a repo's history as a series of commits. Each commit contains anything that changed since the previous commit. This allows Git to store history very efficiently, and replay that history to reconstruct the working directory -- the folder on your computer where you edit files, add the changes, and then make commits. Commits are separate from the working directory. They're essentially snapshots of all of the files in the working directory at specific points in time.\n",

    "The working directory is the folder we're version controlling with Git, and the contents of the working directory are what we see when we list the contents of the folder with ls. In our case, /home/dq/chatbot is the working directory. We can edit the working directory by changing or adding files.\n",

    "In this example, we have one file named README.md in the working directory. There are no files in the staging area, and no commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run git add, Git adds the difference between the most recent commit and the current status of our working directory to the staging area, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run git commit, we create a commit that contains all of the changes Git added to the staging area. The commit has a unique commit hash, so we can refer to it later. Note how making a commit removes all changes from the staging area:\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a commit with the hash 53d. This commit is a snapshot of the working directory at the moment it contained a file called README.md that had the text This is a README!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can add a new file to the working directory, and edit README.md. This will only affect the working directory, where we're making changes -- not the remote:\n",

    "We can pull up the difference between two commits with the git diff command -- we just pass the two commit hashes as arguments to git diff. To save typing time, we can also just write the first few characters of the hash to uniquely identify the commit (four is usually enough).
