    "First, we need to create a file. While there are several ways to do this, we'll start with the touch command. This command will create an empty file with the name we give it. For example, typing touch file.txt will create a new file called file.txt in the current directory. We can open the file and edit it later on if we want.\n",

    "\n",
    "It prints this text into a stream called standard output, or stdout. Every program writes to standard output, and receives input through standard input (stdin). Whenever a program experiences an error while running, it writes the error message to standard error (stderr). These standard streams are how programs show us output in the terminal, and how we enter input.\n",
    "\n",
    "stdout and stderr usually display on the monitor, while stdin is the input from the keyboard. In this case, echo is taking a string from stdin, and printing that string to stdout. By default, we see the message that it prints to stdout, because it shows on the monitor.\n",

    "owner - The user who created the file or folder\n",
    "group - Users in the owner's group (on Unix systems, an owner can place users in groups)\n",
    "everyone - All other users on the system who aren't the user or in the user's group\n",
    "Each scope can have any of three permissions (a scope can have multiple permissions at once):\n",
    "\n",
    "read - The ability to see what's in a file (if defined on a folder, the ability to see what files are in a folder)\n",
    "write - The ability to modify a file (if a folder, the ability to delete, modify, and rename files in the folder)\n",
    "execute - The ability to run a file (some files are executable, and need this permission to run)\n",
    "Each permission can be granted or denied to each scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the permissions on files and folders using ls -l. This command will display the permissions to the left of each file name. Here's an example of what the output looks like:\n",

The downside to symbolic notation is that if we want to change permissions, it takes a long time to type the changes out. We can do this more quickly by representing permissions with octal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Octal notation allows us to represent the permissions for all scopes with just 4 digits, rather than the 10 characters involved in symbolic notation. There are 8 possible combinations of the three permissions r, w, and x. We can express each combination, or scope, as a single digit in an octal (base 8) counting system.\n",

    "--- : No permissions; corresponds to 0\n",

    "Rather than relying on extensions to determine file type, Unix-based operating systems like Linux use media types, which are also called MIME types. The MIME type application/pdf indicates that a file is a pdf, and the MIME type image/png indicates that a file is a png image. The first part of the MIME type string is for the type, such as application or image, and the second part is for the subtype, such as pdf or png.\n",
