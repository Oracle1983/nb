    "3. Beyond Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are great for writing quick functions we can pass into PySpark methods with simple logic. They fall short when we need to write more customized logic, though. Thankfully, PySpark lets us define a function in Python first, then pass it in. Any function that returns a sequence of data in PySpark (versus a guaranteed Boolean value, like filter() requires) must use a yield statement to specify the values that should be pulled later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with the yield statement in Python, read this excellent Stack Overflow answer on the topic. To summarize, yield is a Python technique that allows the interpreter to generate data on the fly and pull it when necessary, instead of storing it to memory immediately. Because of its unique architecture, Spark takes advantage of this technique to reduce overhead and improve the speed of computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark runs the named function on every element in the RDD and restricts it in scope. Each instance of the function only has access to the object(s) you pass into the function, and the Python libraries available in your environment. If you try to refer to variables outside the scope of the function or import libraries, those actions may cause the computation to crash. That's because Spark compiles the function's code to Java to run on the RDD objects (which are also in Java).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, not all functions require us to use yield; only the ones that generate a custom sequence of data do. For map() or filter(), we use return to return a value for every single element in the RDD we're running the functions on."

    "In the following code cell, we'll use the flatMap() method with the named function hamlet_speaks to check whether a line in the play contains the text HAMLET in all caps (indicating that Hamlet spoke). flatMap() is different than map() because it doesn't require an output for every element in the RDD. The flatMap() method is useful whenever we want to generate a sequence of values from an RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want an RDD object that contains tuples of the unique line IDs and the text \"hamlet speaketh!,\" but only for the elements in the RDD that have \"HAMLET\" in one of the values. We can't use the map() method for this because it requires a return value for every element in the RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want each element in the resulting RDD to have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first value should be the unique line ID (e.g.'hamlet@0') , which is the first value in each of the elements in the split_hamlet RDD.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we've discussed before, Spark has two kinds of methods, transformations and actions. While we've explored some of the transformations, we haven't used any actions other than take().\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we use an action method, Spark forces the evaluation of lazy code. If we only chain together transformation methods and print the resulting RDD object, we'll see the type of RDD (e.g. a PythonRDD or PipelinedRDD object), but not the elements within it. That's because the computation hasn't actually happened yet.\n",

We need to do this to write an RDD to a CSV, for example. It's also useful for running some basic Python code over a collection without going through PySpark.\n",

    "Running .collect() on an RDD returns a list representation of it. To get a list of all the elements in hamlet_spoken_lines, for example, we would write:\n",

    "7. Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "While we've done some initial cleanup of the Hamlet data set, we hope you have a better idea of how to use PySpark to transform it into a format that's better for data analysis. We also learned how to use actions to explore an RDD before chaining another transformation to it.\n",
