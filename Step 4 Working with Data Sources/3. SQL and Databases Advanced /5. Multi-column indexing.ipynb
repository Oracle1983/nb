    "We'll continue to work with factbook.db, a SQLite database that contains information about each country in the world. Recall that this database contains just the facts table and each row represents a single country. While we created indexes for the facts table in this database in the previous mission, this version of factbook.db contains no indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "name -- the name of the country.\n",
    "area -- the total land and sea area of the country.\n",
    "population -- the population of the country.\n",

    "SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population > 1000000 AND population_growth < 2.0;\n",
    "We'll also explore how to modify the queries we write to better take advantage of indexes. For example, if we create an index for the name column, we'll explore why the following query:\n",

    "To start, let's write and run a query that involves filtering on more than 1 column and use the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN statement to understand what SQLite is doing to return the results.

    "4. Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall, SQLite returns only a high-level query plan when you use the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN statement in front of a query. This means that you'll often have to augment the returned query plan with your own understanding of the available indexes. In this case, the facts table has 2 indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "one ordered by population called pop_idx,\n",
    "one ordered by population_growth, called pop_growth_idx.\n",
    "SQLite struggles to take advantage of both indexes since each index is optimized for lookups on just that column. SQLite can use the indexes to quickly find the row id values where either population is greater than 1000000 or where population_growth is less than 0.05. If SQLite uses the index of population values to return all of the row id values where population is less than 1000000, it can't use those id values to search the pop_growth_idx index quickly to find the rows where population_growth is less than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the query plan, you can infer that SQLite first decided to use the pop_growth_idx index to return the id values for the rows where population_growth was less than 0.05. Then, SQLite used a binary search on the facts table to access the row at each id value, add that row to a temporary collection if the value for population was greater than 1000000, and return the collection of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why SQLite chose the pop_growth_idx instead of the pop_idx. This is because when there are 2 possible indexes available, SQLite tries to estimate which index will result in better performance. Unfortunately, to keep SQLite lightweight, limited ability was added to estimate and plan accurately and SQLite often ends up picking an index at random."

    "5. Multi-column index\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like this, we need to create a multi-column index that contains values from both of the columns we're filtering on. This way, both criteria in the WHERE statement can be evaluted in the index itself and the facts table will only be queried at the end when we have the specific row id values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a multi-column index for population and population_growth would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the single column indexes we've created in the past contain just the primary key column (population) and the row id (id) columns, this multi-column index contains the population_growth column as well. SQLite can:\n",
    "\n",
    "use binary search to find the first row in this index where population is greater than 1000000,\n",
    "add the row to a temporary collection if population_growth is less than 0.05,\n",
    "advance to the next row (the index is ordered by population) and check if it's greater than 1000000,\n",
    "add the row to a temporary collection if population_growth is less than 0.05,\n",
    "when the end of the index is reached, look up each row in facts using the id values from the temporary collection.\n",
    "This way the facts table is only accessed at the end and the index is used to process the WHERE criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a multi-column index, we need to specify which of the columns we want as the primary key. In the example above, this means that SQLite can use binary search to quickly jump to the first row that matches a specific population value but not for jumping to the first row that matches a specific population_growth value."

    "\n",
    "This time, SQLite used the multi-column index pop_pop_growth_idx that we created instead of either pop_growth_idx or pop_idx. SQLite only needed to access the facts table to return the rest of the column values for the rows that met the WHERE criteria. This is only because the pop_pop_growth_idx doesn't contain the other values (besides population and population_growth already).\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we restricted the columns in the SELECT that we want returned to just population and population_growth? In this case, SQLite will not need to interact with the facts table since the pop_pop_growth_idx can service the query. When an index contains all of the information necessary to answer a query, it's called a covering index. Since the index covers for the actual table and can return the requested results to the query, SQLite doesn't need to query the actual table. For many queries, especially as your data gets larger, this can be much more efficient.\n",

If a query we write only touches a column in the database that we have a single-column index for, SQLite will use only the index to service the query.
