The researchers' approach ensured that the participants' different skill levels and length preferences didn't skew the results.\n",

    "6. Overview of Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, we usually try to avoid writing code that will generate errors. Even so, errors can be quite useful to us because they tell us what went wrong with our code. We can use this information to improve our program's logic. If part of our code fails, we can check why it failed, and execute some other code instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to handle errors gracefully during code execution so that our program doesn't crash, however. This is where exception handling comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is a broad characterization of what can go wrong with a program. When a statement is syntactically correct but something goes wrong during execution (a division by zero occurs or the interpreter tries to read a non-existent file, for example), the compiler raises an exception. An important distinction is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, whereas syntax errors such as forgetting a colon or mispelling a variable don't, because your code won't run to begin with."

    "7. Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when we write Python code, the interpreter will raise an exception (report an error) and then continue executing the rest of the code. We'll see the exception, but our program will keep running as if it never happened. This is undesireable, because our program probably relies on the previous statements to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to handle exceptions by observing when they occur and reacting to them accordingly instead. This way, every piece of code that executes is deliberate, and we have complete control over what our program does. In Python, we use a try-except block to handle exceptions. Consider this piece of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    impossible_value = int(\"Not an integer\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot convert string to integer\")\n",
    "When the Python interpreter sees this code, it attempts to execute the try section of the statement. If the interpreter raises any exceptions within the try section (if we hit some sort of error), our code will attempt to catch it, or handle it gracefully with different code. In our example, the except statement is that different code. It will catch the exception and print out our message because we anticipated that a ValueError could occur, and built the error handling in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this code block:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    s = f.readline()\n",

    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot convert data to floating point value\")\n",
    "except IOError:\n",
    "    print(\"Could not read file\")\n",
    "Here, we caught a couple different types of exceptions that we suspected could arise during the execution of the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, we have the ability to catch any exception by writing an except: section without specifying a particular error. This is a sort of \"catch-all\" that works like an else: section. Using a catch-all for exceptions is usually bad practice, however. Trying to catch every exception without being specific is dangerous because then we can't execute exception-specific logic, and it means we may not understand our code as fully as we should.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we catch every exception in a single statement, we can't react to the exception that occurred because we have no idea what type it is. Instead, we should try catching as many specific exceptions as we possibly can. To do this, we need to think about the exceptions our code might cause, then catch and react to each one individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are still times when implementing a catch-all after we've caught all of the expected exceptions is a good idea. We may want to catch the unknown exception, store it somewhere so we can find what went wrong later on, and then change our code to handle that particular exception."
