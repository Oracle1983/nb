    "Another major type of machine learning is called unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, we aren't trying to predict anything. Instead, we're finding patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main unsupervised learning [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning] techniques is called clustering. We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. For example, we can cluster NBA players based on their statistics. Here's how such a clustering might look:\n",

In the US, the 2 main political parties are the Democrats, who tend to be liberal, and the Republicans, who tend to be conservative. Senators can also choose to be unaffiliated with a party, and vote as Independents, although very few choose to do so.\n",
