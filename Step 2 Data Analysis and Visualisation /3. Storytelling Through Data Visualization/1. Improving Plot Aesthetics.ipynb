    "In the Exploratory Data Visualization course, we learned how to use visualizations to explore and understand data. Because we were focused on exploring trends and getting familiar with the data, we didn't focus much on tweaking the appearance of the plots to make them more presentable to others. We instead focused on the workflow of quickly creating, tweaking, displaying, and iterating on plots.\n",

In this mission, we'll start with a standard matplotlib plot and improve its appearance to better communicate the patterns we want a viewer to understand. Along the way, we'll introduce the principles that informed those changes and provide a framework for you to apply them in the future.

This plot instead tells the story of two distinct periods. In the first period, from 1970 to around 1987, women were a minority when it came to majoring in Biology while in the second period, from around 1987 to around 2012, women became a majority. You can see the point where women overtook men where the lines intersect. While a viewer could have reached the same conclusions using the individual line chart of just the women percentages, it would have required more effort and mental processing on their part.\n",

We're interested in helping people understand the gender gap in different fields across time. These excess elements, sometimes known as chartjunk, increase as we add more plots for visualizing the other degrees, making it harder for anyone trying to interpret our charts. In general, we want to maximize the data-ink ratio, which is the fractional amount of the plotting area dedicated to displaying the data.\n",

As we increase the data-ink ratio, we decrease non-data ink that can help a viewer understand certain aspects of the plots.

These elements are part of the non-data ink in the chart. By keeping the non-data ink as consistent as possible across multiple plots, differences in those elements stick out easily to the viewer. This is because our visual processing systems are excellent at discerning differences quickly and brings them to the front of our thought process.
