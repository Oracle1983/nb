    "If we multiply first, we get 10 - 1, which equals 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we subtract first, we get 2 * 4, which equals 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We definitely want the results of these operations to be consistent; we don't want to get 8 one time and 9 the next. A default \"order of operations\" exists for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponents occur first. That means if we raise something to a power (x ** y), that operation will execute before anything else. Multiplication (x * y) and division (x / y) occur next. They are equal to each other in priority. Addition (x + y) and subtraction (x - y) will occur last. They are also equal to each other in priority.\n",

    "We'll explore how the calculations work later. For now, though, we'll focus on the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An r-value ranges from -1 to 1, and indicates how strongly two variables are correlated.\n",

    "A 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. This would appear as a straight, upward-sloping line on our plots.\n",

    "Any correlation between -1 and 0 will show up as a scattering of points. The same is true of correlations falling between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 0, the more random the points will appear. The closer it is to -1 or 1, the more \"line-like\" the points will appear.\n",
