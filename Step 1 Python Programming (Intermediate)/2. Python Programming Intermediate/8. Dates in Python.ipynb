    "\n",
    "There are a few modules in Python's Standard Library that deal with dates and times. One is the time [https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html] module, which deals primarily with Unix timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Unix timestamp is a floating point value with no explicit mention of day, month, or year. This value represents the number of seconds that have passed since the \"epoch\", or the first second of the year 1970. So, a timestamp of 0.0 would represent the epoch, and a timestamp of 60.0 would represent one minute after the epoch. We can represent any date after 1970 this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the current Unix timestamp, we use the time.time() [https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time] function.\n",

This function takes a timestamp as an argument, and returns an instance of the struct_time class. struct_time instances have attributes that represent the current time in other ways.\n",

    "tm_year: The year of the timestamp\n",
    "tm_mon: The month of the timestamp (1-12)\n",

    "tm_hour: The hour of the timestamp (0-23)\n",
    "tm_min: The minute of the timestamp (0-59)\n",

    "Note the value for the hour from the last screen. The time module always results in a UTC time. UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time. This is the accepted time standard within the programming community. It corresponds to the mean solar time at 0Â° longitude, or Greenwich Mean Time, except that it doesn't follow daylight saving time. While we can convert UTC to other time zones, we'll use UTC in this mission for simplicity.\n",

    "5. Formatting Dates\n",

Instead of displaying the full timestamp down to the microsecond, we can use the datetime.strftime() [https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior] method to specify how we'd like the string output to be formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datetime.datetime.strftime() method takes a format string as its input. A format string contains special indicators, usually preceded by percent characters (\"%\"), that indicate where certain values should go. For example, suppose we stored a timestamp from March 3, 2010 in the object march3. If we want to format it nicely into the string \"Mar 03, 2010\", we can write the following code:\n",
    "\n",
