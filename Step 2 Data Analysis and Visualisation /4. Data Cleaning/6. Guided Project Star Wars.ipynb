    "2. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?\n",
    "\n",
    "The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from their GitHub repository [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey].\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll be cleaning and exploring the data set in Jupyter notebook. To see a sample notebook containing all of the answers, visit the project's GitHub repository [https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission201Solution.ipynb].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will read the data into a pandas dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "star_wars = pd.read_csv(\"star_wars.csv\", encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\n",
    "We need to specify an encoding because the data set has some characters that aren't in Python's default utf-8 encoding. You can read more about character encodings on developer Joel Spolsky's blog [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html].\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has several columns, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)\n",
    "Gender - The respondent's gender\n",
    "Age - The respondent's age\n",
    "Household Income - The respondent's income\n",
    "Education - The respondent's education level\n",
    "Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location\n",
    "Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response\n",
    "Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response\n",
    "There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to remove the invalid rows. For example, RespondentID is supposed to be a unique ID for each respondent, but it's blank in some rows. You'll need to remove any rows with an invalid RespondentID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Read the data set into a dataframe.\n",
    "Explore the data by entering star_wars.head(10). Look for any strange values in the columns and rows.\n",
    "Review the column names with star_wars.columns.\n",
    "Remove any rows where RespondentID is NaN. You can use the pandas.notnull() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.1/generated/pandas.notnull.html] function to accomplish this. Only select rows where the RespondentID column is not null.\n",

    "3. Cleaning and Mapping Yes/No Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the next two columns, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?\n",
    "Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?\n",
    "Both represent Yes/No questions. They can also be NaN where a respondent chooses not to answer a question. We can use the pandas.Series.value_counts() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.1/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html] method on a series to see all of the unique values in a column, along with the total number of times each value appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both columns are currently string types, because the main values they contain are Yes and No. We can make the data a bit easier to analyze down the road by converting each column to a Boolean having only the values True, False, and NaN. Booleans are easier to work with because we can select the rows that are True or False without having to do a string comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the pandas.Series.map() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.Series.map.html] method on series objects to perform the conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we have a series that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "series = [\"Yes\", \"No\", NaN, \"Yes\"]\n",
    "We can use a dictionary to define a mapping from each value in series to a new value:\n",
    "\n",
    "yes_no = {\n",
    "    \"Yes\": True,\n",
    "    \"No\": False\n",
    "}\n",
    "Then, we can call the map() function to perform the mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "series = series.map(yes_no)\n",
    "series will end up looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "[True, False, NaN, True]\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Convert the Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? column to the Boolean type.\n",
    "Convert the Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? column to the Boolean type.\n",
    "When you're finished, both columns should only contain the values True, False, and NaN."

    "\n",
    "The next six columns represent a single checkbox question. The respondent checked off a series of boxes in response to the question, Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for this question are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply. - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.\n",
    "Unnamed: 4 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.\n",

    "Unnamed: 7 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
    "Unnamed: 8 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.\n",
    "For each of these columns, if the value in a cell is the name of the movie, that means the respondent saw the movie. If the value is NaN, the respondent either didn't answer or didn't see the movie. We'll assume that they didn't see the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to convert each of these columns to a Boolean, then rename the column something more intuitive. We can convert the values the same way we did earlier, except that we'll need to include the movie title and NaN in the mapping dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we had this column series:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace\", NaN, \"Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace\"]\n",
    "We could convert the values using this mapping dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace\": True,\n",
    "    NaN: False\n",
    "}\n",
    "After calling the map() method on a series, the column should only contain the values True and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to rename the columns to better reflect what they represent. We can use the pandas.DataFrame.rename() [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html] method on dataframes to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The df.rename() method works a lot like map(). We pass it a dictionary that maps the current column names to new ones:\n",

    "star_wars = star_wars.rename(columns={\n",
    "    \"Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply.\": \"seen_1\"\n",

    "The pandas.DataFrame.rename() method will only rename the columns we specify in the dictionary, and won't change the names of other columns. The code above will rename the Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply. column to seen_1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Convert each column above so that it only contains the values True and False.\n",
    "You can select the column names more quickly by entering star_wars.columns[3:9], rather than typing them out.\n",
    "Be very careful with spacing when constructing your mapping dictionary! In the cells, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace has two spaces between the end of Episode I and the start of The Phantom, but this is not the case in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. Check the values in the cells carefully to make sure you use the appropriate spacing.\n",
    "Rename each of the columns above so the names are more intuitive. We recommend using seen_1 to indicate whether the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, seen_2 for Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, and so on.\n",
    "When you're finished, the columns should have intuitive names, along with True and False values that indicate whether the respondent saw each of the six Star Wars movies."
