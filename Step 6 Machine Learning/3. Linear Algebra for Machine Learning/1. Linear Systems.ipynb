    "In the last course, we explored the framework of calculus and used it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "understand the slope of linear functions\n",
    "understand the derivative (slope as a function) of nonlinear functions\n",
    "find extreme values in nonlinear functions\n",
    "While we learned the basics of slope through linear functions, we primarily focused on nonlinear functions in the last course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll focus on understanding linear functions. Specifically, we'll explore the framework of linear algebra, which provides a way to represent and understand the solutions to systems of linear equations. A system of linear equations consists of multiple, related functions with a common set of variables. The word linear equation is often used interchangeably with linear function. Many real world processes can be modeled using multiple, related linear equations. We'll start by exploring a concrete example of a linear system, another word for system of linear equations, before we dive further into linear algebra.\n",
