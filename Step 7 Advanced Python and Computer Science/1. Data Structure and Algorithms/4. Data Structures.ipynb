    "1. What is a Data Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure is a way of organizing data. Lists and dictionaries are examples of data structures we've already seen, but there are many more. Specifically, data structures are concerned with organization of data within a program, rather than the raw data we read into a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of data structure depends on a few factors. The first and most important consideration is the structure of the data we're storing. If we want to store a batch of strings with no other related data, we would just use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor to weigh when choosing a data structure is time efficiency. Inserting, deleting, or finding items in data structures may take different amounts of time for different data structures, which is important to consider when we want to process data efficiently."

    "2. An Overview of Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic data structure is an array. An array is a list that contains items.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of computer memory as a long chain of memory slots. Computers store arrays in memory in a very intuitive way. They store the first element of an array right next to the second element, which is next to the third, and so on. Each element in an array occupies a slot in that array. So, in an array of 10 elements, we can say definitively which item is in the first slot, the second slot, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this storage pattern is very predictable, it's very easy to access a given element by its index. However, elements all have to be shifted when we delete or add an element to the middle of the list, which can make those operations quite costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically can't expand an array beyond its initial size. So, if we create an array of size 10, it can only hold 10 elements."

    "7. 2D Array Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't fully understand a data structure without first analyzing its time complexity. 2D arrays are tricky though. We haven't really discussed whether we can expand our 2D array, and even if we could, the process would be awkward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, let's make a few assumptions about the 2D arrays we're using. First and foremost, let's assume they're static. In other words, their size does not change. Another simplifying assumption that follows is that insertion into our 2D arrays simply replaces whatever element was there, and that deletion leaves an \"empty\" slot in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only interesting complexity analysis involves accessing elements of a 2D array. Since deletion and insertion replace elements, their complexities will be the same as array access because we always have to find the element we're dealing with first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing by index is constant time because we're really dealing with an array of arrays. Accessing the row is constant time because the row is just an element in a regular array. Then, accessing the element within that row is constant time again. Nothing depends on the size of the array, so it's constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider searching for an element (accessing by value). Let's call the height of our array m, and the width n. Behind the scenes, we're really working with an array of size m, where each element in the array is an array of size n. This is simply the array-of-arrays implementation we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're searching for an element. Under the worst case scenario, we have to touch every slot in the array once to find what we're looking for. Because the array is m rows by n columns, there are m * n total slots. We touch each slot once, so our time complexity is O(m * n).\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks a bit different than the time complexities we've seen before, but we need to remember what time complexity represents. Our input size has both height and width, and the time our search takes increases as either m or n grows. Thus, O(m * n) makes sense for the time complexity of a 2D array traversal."

A hash table is a clever construct that takes advantage of this property by converting keys to indexes using a hash function. A hash function accepts a key as input and converts it to an integer index. This way, we can find the appropriate index for any key.\n",

    "Let's say our city_populations dictionary contains 10 cities. We could write a hash function that converts the city names to the indexes between 0 and 9, but it's very likely that it would convert multiple cities to the same index. When two keys map to the same index, we have a collision. We want to avoid collisions.\n",

It then stores the population of New York in slot 4955. When we want to access the population of New York later on, it does exactly the same thing: computes the index, and retrieves the population.\n",
