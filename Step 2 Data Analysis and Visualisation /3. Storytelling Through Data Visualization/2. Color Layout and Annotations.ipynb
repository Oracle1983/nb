In this mission, we'll focus more directly on customizing colors, line widths, layout, and annotations to improve the ability for a viewer to extract insights from the charts. We'll continue to use the same data set containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012\n",

When selecting colors, we need to be mindful of people who have some amount of color blindness. People who have color blindness have a decreased ability to distinguish between certain kinds of colors. The most common form of color blindness is red-green color blindness, where the person can't distinguish between red and green shades. Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women of Northern European descent suffer from red-green color blindness.\n",
