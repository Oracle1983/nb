    "then select and filter the rows that are greater than the average value\n",
    "If we had to do this using Python and pandas, we would compute and store the average value in ShareWomen as a variable and then use the variable in a table filter. While variables dominate how we express logic object oriented programming languages like Python and Java, SQL doesn't have support for variables. The designers of SQL, a declarative programming language, want it's users to focus on expressing computations over explicitly defining, setting, and juggling variables.\n",

    "The subquery is run first and returns the average value for the ShareWomen column (which happens to be 0.5225502029537575). Based on the result of the subquery, SQL will replace the subquery with this value dynamically. Note that SQL will ignore the column name (AVG(ShareWomen)) and is smart enough to just use the actual row value. Here's a diagram that makes the flow clearer:\n",

If you instead try to return a table with multiple columns, for example, the following error will be returned:\n",

Specifically, we were interested in rows that were above or below the average value in a specific column.

We'd need to divide the number of rows that met the filter criteria with the total number of rows in the table.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, the subqueries we've used have computed an aggregate value of some kind and returned that value to the outer query to use for filtering.
