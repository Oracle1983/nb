    "In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own. If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook here. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found here. [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015]\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored in the thanksgiving.csv file. It contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.\n",

    "The dataset has 65 columns, and 1058 rows. Most of the column names are questions, and most of the column values are string responses to the questions.
