    "    In this challenge, you'll practice using modules, classes, and list comprehensions to process and represent a data set in Python. You'll be working with data on NFL player suspensions. The FiveThirtyEight team compiled the data set for a piece on domestic violence. You can download it here.[https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nfl-suspensions/nfl-suspensions-data.csv]\n",
